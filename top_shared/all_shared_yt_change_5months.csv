313,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2183lqRNWgc,0,0,{'Newzee'},1,youtube,video,original video,"amber heard turns 35 years old on thursday (april 22).
the texan actress was born in austin in 1986, and had her first starring role in 2006 as a desirable high-school girl invited to a party in horror film ""all the boys love mandy lane"".
in 2008 heard landed roles in ""never back down"" and comedy ""pineapple express"" and in male stripper tale ""magic mike xxl"" in 2015.
in 2011 she starred in ""the rum diary"" opposite future husband, actor johnny depp, 57.
they married in 2015, but had a tempestuous five-year relationship that ended in divorce in may 2016, following accusations of assault against heard.
depp, star of films including ""pirates of the caribbean"" and ""edward scissorhands,"" went to london's high court last year to sue the sun newspaper and one of its journalists over a tabloid article that stated he had been violent towards his ex-wife.
high court judge andrew nicol ruled last november that depp had violently assaulted heard, at times putting her in fear for her life. that decision came after three weeks of hearings where the court heard sensational claim and counter-claim from both parties about violent outbursts which each accused the other of committing.
in march this year, depp's legal team applied for permission to appeal the high court ruling upheld that he was a wife beater and to rely on further evidence. his lawyers said heard's claim that she had donated her divorce settlement to charity was a ""calculated lie"".
depp has also filed a $50 million defamation lawsuit against heard in a virginia court over an opinion piece she wrote in the washington post.
heard is also known for playing mera in dc comics' 2018 superhero film ""aquaman"", opposite ""game of thrones"" actor jason momoa in the title role of the half-human, half-atlantean character.
she is set to reprise the 'queen of the sea' role in version 2 of ""aquaman"", slated for 2022. the character also features in 2017 action adventure ""justice league"".
heard is also a human rights activist and #metoo campaigner.
in october 2018 she told a united nations audience in geneva that hollywood falls ""way behind"" when it comes to human rights and has a responsibility to change.

what happened in 2015?
johnny depp and amber heard were on a trip from honolulu, usa to brisbane, australia in 2015. that doesn‚Äôt sound so bad, does it? it actually sounds like a fun little trip, but as we all know by now that amber is known to pull off a great facade in front of the public and she did the same in 2015.

amber heard was quite stubborn in taking two of her yorkshire terriers, boo and pistol, along with her. unfortunately, australia is pretty strict with their animal policies and do conduct a strict check at the borders and during immigration. 

if so, how were they able to take the dogs?
amber heard is quite cheeky when it comes to escaping the law. she managed to take her dogs and enter the country until she was caught leading amber to face the court. 

well at that time we all believed her to be innocent and that she hadn't known about these rules as she has stated, and all was forgiven. but only after her divorce and lawsuit did the australian government decide to look into this case yet again. the case currently holds a status of ongoing and we are pretty sure that this is going to cause her a lot of trouble holistically. 

so what do these documents contain?
in simple words, the documents contain information stating that everything she stated back in 2015 are complete lies. that is not a shocker for us at this point but yes that is the truth of what the documents contain. 

quick recap from the past, what did amber defend herself when she was called onto the pedestal to plead her case?
amber stated that she did not know that such a law existed in australia. she stated that it was all a misunderstanding and that she wasn‚Äôt aware that it would cost her a lot. in fact, shortly after all those events happened, she and depp put up their video showcasing them in a sorry state being extremely apologetic about what they did and how much they love and respect australia. 

want to know something funny about this, amber stated to have forgotten to claim her dogs or whatever set of lies she was rapping at that point but guess what she didn‚Äôt forget to claim? 

now, who is kate james and kevin murphy?
kate james was amber heard‚Äôs personal assistant and she worked for amber heard for 3 years from march 2012 to february 2015. kevin murphy on the other hand was someone who worked for depp for almost 8 years and was caught into this huge mess unknowingly.

as someone famous once said, it is the people who try to do good who get into trouble while the guilty always seem to have it easier. this is partially true, but karma is real and it surely is served cold to the people who deserve it.

kevin knew about the issues that would arise if the dogs were taken without proper documentation. he even spoke to amber about it on call and even in person stating that it was a bad idea. but being the stubborn individual she is, refused to take heed to his advice and took things into her own hand.

kevin rejected her offer but then was verbally threatened by amber due to which he succumbed under pressure to do so. later on, after she divorced depp, he tried to retract his claim as he no longer worked for them and wanted to turn his wrongs into rights as the guilt was killing him.

kevin also stated that he had told amber to proceed in taking her dogs in the right way by filling out the paperwork and only then taking her dogs overseas. but due to this entailing a ten-day quarantine which she wasn‚Äôt patient enough to endure, she chose to take the shortcut which came to bite her back. 

the worst-case scenario involves her facing jail time that can be for a minimum of 5 years to a maximum of 15 years. now that is a lot, especially if it was for just being stubborn over taking your dogs with you. how old are you amber? 5?

to make this situation messier, aquaman 2 is also going to be shot there which means amber heard could lose her role as mera to this mistake of hers, that she forgot to cover up. dear amber, you cannot hide the skeleton in the closet forever. but if she does get kicked out of aquaman 2 for this, we are pretty sure fans would be glad. #amberheard #johnydepp #aquaman2 #johnnydeppcase #amberheardcase #thespotlight #ah",562.0,20995.0,,,,,,20283.0,23.0,0.0,127.0,amber heard makes career ending mistake she will regret!!,,,,,,,,,,

chla charity livestream - #justiceforjohnnydepp community support the children

aside from being a renowned actor, singer, musician, and writer - johnny depp has always had a charitable heart, whether it be dressing up as jack sparrow to visit sick kids in the hospital or privately donating his own funds to causes he is passionate about. 
as part of his divorce settlement agreement between himself and his ex-wife amber heard, he agreed to pay $7 million dollars on her behalf, which would be split evenly between the aclu and the chla. 
as of january 7th, 2021 the public has received indisputable evidence which tells them that amber heard, who insisted the funding be given directly to her and not the charities for her to donate directly, failed to keep her promise to both the public and the children‚Äôs hospital of la and did not donate the $3.5 million. 
chla is a nonprofit that admits approximately 14,600 child patients every year, including those with cancer and long-term illnesses. they rely completely on their donors for financial support. as a group, members of the justice for johnny depp community have decided to put together this page to be able to raise money so that the children get the attention and care they deserve. help us stand up for the truth, against injustice, and help the children.

______________________________________________
amber heard is now rumoured to be in talks to star in a mera hbo max spinoff tv series, which might get some fans a bit riled up. this rumour comes from daniel richtman‚Äôs patreon page.

in this video are going to share the full news on amber heard reportedly talks for mera in hbo max spinoff. 

this comes after months of speculation that amber heard might be replaced as mera in aquaman 2, however, it sounds as though warner bros. pictures are very much on heard‚Äôs side. when i say on heard‚Äôs side, i‚Äôm of course talking about the whole amber heard vs. johnny depp case.

warner bros. pictures asked johnny depp to step down from the role of grindelwald in fantastic beasts 3. they did this after he lost his libel case against the sun in the united kingdom. it was then revealed that warner bros. pictures‚Äô executives are not paying any attention to the online petitions demanding that heard be removed from aquaman 2.

this is something that i‚Äôm pretty sure a vast number of dc comics and dceu fans will not like to hear. there‚Äôs been a huge number of people who are very much against amber heard and do not want to see her as mera in the dceu any more. that said, the likes of zack snyder and other executives over at wb are very much fans of the actress. zack snyder actually recently revealed that he would love to work with heard again. the two of them worked together on the reshoots fos snyder‚Äôs upcoming justice league cut, which will also be coming to hbo max.

other than this, amber heard‚Äòs dceu future has been constantly called into question, thanks to the fallout of the actress‚Äô messy divorce from johnny depp. however, despite the sizeable backlash against the aquaman star online, warner bros. is sticking by her. that‚Äôs definitely how it seems, anyways, given that depp‚Äôs been fired from the fantastic beasts franchise while heard has said she‚Äôs excited to return as mera in aquaman 2. not only that, but she might even get her own vehicle as the future queen of the oceans.

according to insider daniel richtman, heard has reportedly had talks with the studio about doing a mera tv show, which would end up on hbo max. that‚Äôs all richtman, who shared the intel on his patreon page, has revealed at the moment, but this info does add up with everything we‚Äôve heard about wb‚Äôs plans to expand the dceu onto the small screen and make use of their new streaming service. after all, they‚Äôre going to want to create as many offshoots from the movies as they can, so it adds up that they would explore doing more with one of the dc universe‚Äôs leading ladies.

of course, this is just what one source is saying and beyond the trailer‚Äôs grace randolph has painted a very different picture of what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes with her own scoops. randolph‚Äôs claimed that aquaman 2 is being written in such a way to allow for mera‚Äôs role to be reduced if things go against her in her next lawsuit with depp. furthermore, a new female supporting lead ‚Äì possibly played by an asian actress ‚Äì is apparently being added in to ‚Äúbalance things out.‚Äù mera has a long dc comics history, so there‚Äôs a lot of material to work with there if wb did end up moving ahead with a spinoff for amber heard. and the world clearly wants more from the aqua-verse, given the first movie‚Äôs $1 billion global gross. 

but how do you feel about a possible mera show, likely following 2022‚Äôs aquaman 2? would you watch a mera spinoff tv show on hbo max? sound off with your thoughts in the comments section below and if you haven‚Äôt subscribed to my channel yet, please do so. see you in the next video.

unfortunately, lots of things have been moved around due to the incidents that had taken place throughout 2020. what i mean by this is there were a lot of comic book movies that were supposed to be released, but unfortunately, this did not happen. but looking on the bright side of things, it just may be that this will not be the same case for the year 2021, as comic book movies may just make their normal appearances yet again, along with other movies in general. aquaman 2 is one that just may be making its appearance to be the big screen, but there seems to be a bit of a problem with one individual cast member, and by now i think you can guess who i am talking about. allow us to break it all down for you but first be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel below.

johnny depp has filed a $50 million lawsuit against ex wife amber heard , as time goes more and more high-profile stars have been caught in the middle.and now tesla ceo elon musk has been wrapped up in the drama as well. 
in today's video we are going to discuss about johnny depp reportedly dragging elon musk into the libel case against amber heard. 

last week johnny depp's side things received good news when it was announced that his defamation case against amber heard would be going forward in virginia following reports that covid19 concerns would place the trial on hold days prior. depp's allegations come after amber heard's 2018 washington post op-ed, where she accused the fantastic beasts actor of domestic violence. depp denies these claims and has called them an ""elaborate hoax"" to advance her own career. 

british newspaper metro.co.uk was first to report that depp's attorney has issued a subpoena against musk ,the tesla ceo and heard's former boyfriend.new york post website page six also followed up with a similar story hours later. 

the latest development in the legal battle involves an alleged affair johnny depp claims amber heard had with tech mogul elon musk while they were still married. heard and musk have confirmed to have been in a relationship shortly after the rum diary co-stars called it quits in 2016, but depp has gathered information that points to the two possibly being together before that. 

depp's attorney adam waldman told the publications ,""we have now issued subpoenas to amber heard, her hoax assisting friends, elon musk and other witnesses to explain the avalanche of the video, audio, photographic and testimonial evidence with which we intend to confront them."" 

a source told page six, however ""musk has not received anything"" as yet. he and heard split in february 2018 following an on-off relationship.heard also told that the pair now enjoy a ""beautiful friendship"" based on ""intellectual curiosity, ideas and conversation, a shared love for science.""

recent surveillance footage from the garage of their building has amber heard and elon musk next to each other in an elevator, per news 18. in addition to this, a lawsuit file statement makes the following claims: 

only one month after mr. depp and ms. heard were married - while mr depp was out of the country, filming in march 2015- eastern columbia building personnel testified that ms. heard received musk 'late night' at mr depp's penthouse. specially ms. heard asked staff at the eastern columbia building to give her friend elon access to the building's parking garage and the penthouse elevator 'late at night' and they testified that they did so. building staff would then see mrs. heard's friend elon leaving the building the next morning. 

heard asked a judge to dismiss the $50 million law suit on friday. heard filed a motion in the circuit court of fairfax asking for the case to be struck out. she offered new details about instances in which depp `` shaped her, shoved her, pulled her hair and choked her,"" ap said, providing photos as evidence. 

since their divorce mr depp has continued to publically harass ms heard and attempted to gaslight the world by denying his abuse. it is long past time for mr depp's despicable conduct to end. heard's attorney told ap. 
depp's lawyer waldman denied the claims and said it was heard who abused his client. in an email to ap, he added "" the only way for amber heard to sustain her hoax is with more lies.""

in hollywood, there are many stars that have ruined their own careers. these celebrities will do things that destroy their reputation and expose their true selves. 

in the case of amber heard, this situation is entirely different. her destruction has been more of a ‚Äúslow burn."" because she‚Äôs tried so hard to convince people she‚Äôs a good girl and a victim, but is not getting exposed as actually something else entirely. 

amber's life has taken a downward spiral but she now takes time to thank her fans for their support. all while, johnny depp rebuilds his reputation that amber heard tried to destroy.

i highly recommend following colonel kurtz on her channel! she‚Äôs got some great content, and puts a lot of heart and effort into her work.

people need to know that amber heard is a dangerous individual, and paula is the second person recently to come out with uncomfortable stories regarding amber. there was another woman and model who recently came forward with allegations of sexual assault by amber heard. it‚Äôs said she did a podcast that will be posted soon, after she gets a police report established, so please keep an eye out for that as well.

 winona ryder

first of all in the list we have winona ryder! winona ryder is one of the ex-partners of johnny depp and the two dated for four years from 1989 to 1993. both stars got a lot of media attention and their relationship was heavily publicized. she clearly admitted that he was never abusive or violent towards her and that allegations he is a ‚Äúwife-beater‚Äù were ‚Äúimpossible to believe‚Äù. 
in her statement, ryder, said: ‚Äúthe idea that he is an incredibly violent person is the farthest thing from the johnny i knew and loved. i cannot wrap my head around these accusations. he was never, never violent towards me. he was never, never abusive at all towards me. he has never been violent or abusive towards anybody i have seen.‚Äù
she made her point pretty clear that johnny was nothing but pure gentleman in their relationship!

 penelope cruz

guys with several people coming forth, testifying the aquaman star amber heard‚Äôs abusive and ‚Äòmanipulative‚Äô behavior, the latest to step forward was penelope cruz who extended her support to depp in the midst of the drama.
the 45-year-old vanilla sky actor wrote a declaration in support of the pirates of the caribbean star, stating the allegations came as ‚Äòunbelievable‚Äô to her given depp‚Äôs ‚Äòkind‚Äô and ‚Äògenerous‚Äô nature. she even said,
""i do not want to call anyone a liar but from my experience of johnny, it is impossible to believe that such horrific allegations are true. i find it extremely upsetting knowing him as i do,"" 

sharon osbourne

in an interview with cbs's the talk sharon osbourne admitted that she understands depp and heard‚Äôs relationship dynamic because she shares a similar one with her husband ozzy.
the star was quoted telling the leading daily, ""do you know what i think,‚Äù after all ‚Äúit takes two to tango. i think that they had a very vulnerable relationship. i think they're both as bad as each other.‚Äù
so it is wrong to accuse depp only!

the johnny depp and amber heard court drama made a major plot twist when johnny depp filed a defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife. he not only claimed that she lied in court, but also that she was abusive toward him. however, the actors will need to wait even longer to get an official court ruling. if the court rules in johnny depp‚Äôs favor, amber heard could be facing serious consequences.

the possibility of amber heard going to jail already has fans asking who would replace her in aquaman 2. and even if she doesn‚Äôt get sentenced to jail time, based on the information that johnny depp has already released to the public, many fans have petitioned for amber heard to be replaced in aquaman 2 regardless. rumors have even started swirling that emilia clarke would be her replacement. be sure to watch the whole video and see what lies amber heard has been hiding all these years! in addition, do us a favor and like the video and subscribe and turn on the notification bell. we‚Äôll see you in the next video!

the ongoing case between johnny depp and his ex wife, amber heard, is one that has completely shocked the entire celebrity world. fans of both have been trying to discover who is truly the bad guy in this case. mainly because it was made clear at first that johnny depp was the one in the wrong in their relationship but then tons of evidence rose to the surface that it was actually amber heard who was at fault. with new and never seen before evidence rising to the surface, it seems that johnny depp may have more to further back up what he has been saying this whole time and could completely change the outcome of the case. allow us to break it all down for you but first be sure to like this video and subscribe to the channel below!

393,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTguEXUJQOQ,0,0,{'Looper'},1,youtube,video,original video,"among the many changes director zack snyder made to his cut of justice league, he gave a larger role to amber heard, who plays the atlantean princess mera. her character gets a bit more developed in the four-hour film, with a battle against steppenwolf and a role in the knightmare ending that implies aquaman is no longer among the living.

heard was reportedly one of the few actors to be called in to do reshoots when the snyder cut was in production.

after completing those reshoots, heard told comicbook.com,

""i'm super excited about it. we just wrapped on reshoots and i just love nerds. i f---ing love nerds, excuse my language.""

she explained that nerds are often connected to great projects and that ""nerd passion"" drives people to want to be part of something. however, following the release of the movie on hbo max, she revealed something else: that cool atlantean costume she wore basically makes no sense.

in an amusing instagram video uploaded on march 31, heard appears to be in her trailer, wearing her full-body costume complete with the headpiece, though it's not clear whether it's from shooting for the original film or reshoots for the snyder cut. rather than imbuing her with any special powers, though, the costume appears to be hampering her mobility.

heard apparently can't sit down in her costume, not can she do much else. as she tries to hoist herself to a standing position, the actress knocks over a cup, the contents of which form a green pool on the floor. although she gamely tries to grab it off the floor, she can't bend over far enough to reach it. generally, it seems that the bodysuit in question has very little give to it, making it impossible for her to use her knees and also making it difficult for her to bend at the waist. she tries some twists, but nothing seems to work particularly well. heard sardonically captioned the image,

""she's beauty and she's grace.""

fortunately, none of this really shows up in the movie. it's a good thing she's just standing still in some of her dialogue scenes with aquaman. the movie creates an illusion that this outfit is pliant and elastic enough for her to fight alien invaders in it ‚Äî underwater, mind you ‚Äî and comfortable enough for a long trek in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. but in reality, the costume is clearly more about making mera look cool than letting her be functional in any way.

there has been a long history of criticism against how women are often outfitted in superhero media. as activist holly jacobs pointed out in the twitter thread that followed heard's post of her video there,

""practicality is never a priority in outfitting women in the media industry.""

with most costumes, though, the problem is less about inability to move and more about skimpiness. one oft-shared twitter post from the time of the original film's release in 2017 compared the costumes worn by the amazons and designed by lindy hemming for the patty jenkins-directed wonder woman ‚Äî complete with breastplate armor ‚Äî and the leathery, midriff-baring amazon costumes from 2017's justice league, as designed by michael wilkinson.

heard's justice league costume overall is better than many. while form fitting, it is a full-on regal ensemble befitting her station and her role in atlantean culture, complete with a crown, shoulder pad armor, gauntlets, leg and knee armor, and carvings that suggest accents. of course, you could argue that the armor focuses on her chest in unnecessary ways, but it's not as revealing as the costumes many other women have had to wear in superhero movies.

and heard's comparative modesty comes in contrast to jason momoa's general look as aquaman in the film, which basically seems to involve jeans and shirts he's constantly taking off to reveal his bare chest, though later in the movie he also gets a costume upgrade.

so in some ways, the costume deftly avoids some of the usual criticism while, as observed by cbr, it stays true to the version the character wears to war in the comic books. if only she could move in it, she'd be a superhero to be reckoned with.

johnny depp is the sweetest. most humble and genuine actor, artist and musician of our generation. justice for johnny!

""birds of a feather flock together."" james franco is notoriously unloved in hollywood for pushing drugs on people and being a bully. co-stars have come forward exposing him as a sexual assaulter and as being intimidating and cruel on set. wherever he is so is trouble. and amber? well, she cray. sociopathic psychopathic narcissistic and sadistic. did i forget something? oh yea, we love you johnny and the whole world is sorry.

i‚Äôm sure most of you guys have seen ellen‚Äôs show at least once in your life. do keep in mind that this show has won 17 people‚Äôs choice awards and has been very popular among the public. in case you do not know, it‚Äôs basically a talk show where ellen interacts with celebrities and there‚Äôs banter of all sorts. ellen, in her show, comes off as a funny and interesting, yet a kind personality. 2020, however, has not been very good for either ellen or her show. watch this video till the end to see how hard ellen got hit and what allegations are being leveled against her. we all wish ellen really was as kind, nice, and positive as she appears in the show.
 
but[p1]  unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case. guys, remember that this show has gone on for over two decades, aired 3,000+ episodes, and has employed more than a thousand employees. when the entire world was about to go in lockdown in march, a dutch beauty blogger by the name of nikkie de jagger was about to change ellen‚Äôs life. having appeared in her show in january, nikkie made some comments in a dutch talk show that the show had been far from positive for her. she said that the warm and friendly atmosphere presented in the show had nothing to do with reality.

hey guys i would like to make it clear that this trailer is fan made. that means it contains clips from other movies, put together with special effects using wondershare filmora video editor and photopea (photopea.com) photo editor.

‚ñ∫what is fan made movie trailer?

in a nutshell fan made trailers are created for extreme movie fans. that's why its not for everybody because just like pro-wrestling, some hate it some love it. if you are into fan made trailers which means you appreciate bringing new ideas to your favorite movies. but my trailers, are not like any other, one word to describe it, realistic.

‚ñ∫macamtv's purpose

if you are new here my name is jr macam, i'm the man behind your realistic dream trailers. the purpose of the channel is simple (not to trick people haha) , to create a community that is passionate to bring dream movies to life. if that sounds like you want to become a part of, subscribe!!!!

editing details:

creating aquaman 2 was challenging because i was not into this franchsie. but my dc lover side made me appreciate this film more. i watched this film once and i thought it was decent. the fresh clips are not too hard to find since there are plenty of cosplay to chose from. to avoid making this dream trailer feel low budget i chose clips from the aquaman movie it self. such as the atlantic city.

the music was great, despite the lack of humor the soundtrack by the equalizer 2 trailer #2 was great because it had lots of trailer fling to it. the main actor himself had lots of movies to chose from since this is the first time i made a project about him. not the first aquaman project though, i did one back in 2020 for one of the trailer style of the infinity saga.

the line ""is only a myth"" is great connection to how aquaman is a mystical character. the film see had great lines talking about ""gods"" that perfectly fits this dream trailer. speaking of perfectly fits, the clip with aquaman attacks the bad guy we get a transition to a guy getting attacked in the water.

before we head on to the details of amber‚Äôs current situation with warner bros, let us just have a quick recap on what went down between amber heard and johnny depp.

so johnny depp and amber heard were quite the love birds who eventually ended up tying the knot. but after a few years into their marriage, toxicity grew which encompassed ruthless allegations and accusations against depp, leading everyone to favor amber heard out of sympathy. this caused depp‚Äôs career, personal life, and mental health to deteriorate drastically for years together. 

now back to the present, what is trending about amber heard currently?
we all know amber heard to play the role of mera in aquaman and how she did a marvelous job at it. but will she be in its sequel as initially planned is the big question on everyone‚Äôs mind. though many wish to not see her on-screen, due to her cheap ways of getting at depp, the decision finally lies in the hands of warner bros. 

how do we know about the fans not wanting to see her on aquaman 2? 
well, if the 1.8 million-plus signatures on the petition on change.org on trying to get amber heard out of the movie wasn‚Äôt enough proof of how badly the fans want her out, we don‚Äôt know what will!

based on the situations she has been in in the recent past, you may assume that warner bros have removed or would be removing amber from the cast list due to her false allegation scandal but rumors are stating otherwise. in fact, the rumors are quite far away from this reason and are stated to revolve around her health situation being breached.

so, is amber heard really facing some health concerns?
the freshest piece of news about the whole amber heard- aquaman 2 situation entails her being asked to leave the cast due to certain health concerns she is facing. rumour has it that warner bros have stated her not to be fit as she was when she played the role of mera in aquaman, and hence need her to get fit or she shall be replaced. 

in actuality, the contract that entails the signature of the cast member playing the role of mera states that the actor has to be in good form before the shooting. as amber is known very well to play the blame-game, she directly blamed johnny depp for her health deteriorating and causing her to fall into depression which thus affected her body, causing her to place her role in aquaman 2 at stake. 

this may have brought a certain special cast onboard but it's more like a tug of war between the two right now, with the new entry almost playing the role of mera while amber heard is left to get in shape before the shooting of aquaman 2, or else would have to face the consequences of losing the role. 

the fans have spoken out about them wanting emilia clarke to play the role of mera as she seems to be the perfect suitor not just because of her amazing personality but also because she has caused flames to arise with her previous on-screen tv series with jason momoa. yes, the khaleesi has tons of talent and potential to conquer this role with class and make both warner bros and the fans satisfied. 

in fact, in an article by keith flamar in forbes, emilia clarke has been said to have signed that contract to play the role of mera with warner bros. why would forbes lie right?

to add to this, emilia clarke has been seen out and about with a green costume and some dainty red locks complimenting her costume. could this be another hint that we could take, that emilia is playing the role of mera?! we are as confused as you are now but secretly wishing this is true cause we kid you not, we secretly are wishing for her to make it to the big screens with jason momoa again. 

will amber heard attract bad publicity to the movie?
there is a high chance that it may, which is why warner bros. seems to be trying to get rid of her in a subtle way so as to not face the brunt of the consequences. her ongoing court case has been shifted from 2021 to 2022, thus giving her time to shoot for the film without facing any interruptions. but to add to the worries of her court case, amber has been seen galavanting around the world on expensive yachts, especially europe throughout the pandemic, leaving fans to put her sense of responsibility and accountability to test. amber heard aquaman 2 celebrity news clevver newsds

the battle between exes johnny depp and amber heard has been going on much longer than their marriage. their case grows more heated everyday and it can be seen that the effects of the case are only distressing depp even more. everybody doubts his personality and character, and he struggles to show that he is not what people think. if you paid attention to him at some points in his life, he sort of warned, even if you didn't know what was happening to him.

the first warning sign might be a bit controversial, but it's something that needs to be said because of the two of them. amber bombed him with what appeared to be love. what's weird is that shortly after he began dating, amber heard, johnny depp's career began to go off on a tangent. something clearly wasn't right in his life.  it was clear that she had an agenda, namely to get married to johnny in order to progress her own career and/or to benefit financially, and she knew how to bring it about.

it is clear that amber heard was the one who filed for divorce from johnny depp. at one point, amber alleged that depp had physically abused her during their relationship. it was in fact quite shocking to his fans as well as the people who worked with depp, as this side of johnny was never witnessed by them.  when amber provided the court with such reasons, depp denied these accusations and even stated that all this was being done by amber in her best interests, and not his.  johnny depp made a statement that amber heard was the abuser. initially, everyone was siding with amber, but eventually the truth about her violent nature came out.

depp had filed a defamation case against heard. in an article published by the washington post, amber heard shared her feelings about johnny depp, using explicit content, damaging depp's image, leading to the beginning of the $50 million law suit against amber heard. many believed that it was all a joke, that she orchestrated this to gain the public's attention. but she got away really fast with that. with the content of the article being attacked, the lawsuit did not end. over the years, several more elements have been added that have proven to be useful proof in support of depp.

johnny depp released audio of amber heard and himself talking about the abuse. the audio leaks seemed to be an interesting development which puts heard in the spotlight. in the tapes, amber heard and johnny depp can be heard attempting to solve their marriage issues. in one part of the tape, depp accused heard of punching him. this tape was surely a big step in proving depp‚Äôs innocence. at this point, heard was truly exposed for who she was, including all her anger issues and violence she was claimed to have. this was one of the most solid forms of proof that helped enable him to be proved as the innocent in this messy trial.

amber posted the photo of herself, claiming that johnny had hit her with an iphone. amber went to court and received a restraining order against johnny depp. on investigating further into amber‚Äôs bruises, they seemed to be fake, because the next day she made an appearance with no trace, not even a single scratch on her. did she think the truth wouldn't come out at all?

if amber heard truly was the one to have faced being physically harmed but why was johnny depp‚Äôs finger left severed? johnny depp describes a time where amber threw a couple of bottles at him. depp goes into detail on what happened and how his finger was injured due to it. when questioned about his bandages later by dakota johnson, johnny depp answers vaguely. he avoids the question with a joke. later, amber has admitted over audio that she did in fact hit johnny with a bottle and hurt his finger. this was out as a part of the ongoing lawsuit filed against his ex-wife. 

depp did a fabulous job in the movie ‚Äúalice through the looking glass‚Äù. his fans were quite enlightened with his presence on the day of its premiere, but the same cannot be said about johnny depp! unfortunately, we all assumed his speech to include his dark humor which he constantly brings out from time to time but indeed many believe it to be a cry for help.

join us in today‚Äôs video as we show you how amber heard was fired from another movie. celebrity break-ups are a tricky thing. while ending relationships is difficult for all of us, this is exasperated when splitting becomes a public affair. actors johnny depp and amber heard know this all too well, as the former couple has been battling in the press, as well as in court. and now there are rumors about heard being fired from another one of her movies.

johnny depp and amber heard have both alleged abuse against each other, and they continue to clash in court. months ago depp lost his libel suit against the publication the sun, which resulted in the actor being fired from his role as grindelwald in fantastic beasts 3. there were recently reports that heard was also being sacked by warner bros., but it seems they were inaccurate. because of this, is amber heard getting fired as well? be sure to watch the whole video and in addition, do us a favor and like the video and subscribe and turn on the notification bell. we‚Äôll see you in the next video!

following the wild interview that aired on march 7th, with oprah winfrey sitting down with prince harry and meghan markle, social media was flooded with hot takes. some went as far as trying to cancel the entire royal family on twitter, while others were simply showing their support and empathy for megan, who openly admitted to struggling while being under the intense pressure of being a royal. over the course of the interview, the two spoke about some incredibly shocking things, including concerns some of the royal family had, as to how dark the skin color of their first born, archie would be. it seems aside from that, a handful of factors went into the couples departure.

johnny depp has become a household name throughout his career, especially lately with the very public divorce with amber heard. this divorce is explosive in every way that is affecting their image, celebrity status, and finances. johnny depp has been in the public eye since his first experience in the acting world in 1984 when he made an appearance in nightmare on elm street. this movie was just the start of his career, and he is seen as one the most prominent film stars of all time. not only is he an actor, but he is a producer and musician as well. his resume is long and vast, but his marriage to amber heard has been a short and destructive ride. 
johnny depp's early life was not cut and dry with a happy little childhood. he was quiet and withdrawn with drug use and self-harm starting at the age of 12, and this pattern has set a stage that will only worsen and affect his behavior in all areas of his life. his life only got worse when his parents split up, giving johnny the responsibility at 15 to collect the child support since he was the youngest. these events are creating the pattern of failing relationships and mental health that are currently bringing him down. 
johnny depp has had various romantic relationships, actresses, and models, and not all ended disastrously as his current legal battle. the relationship before amber heard was with vanessa paradis, his partner for 14 years, and they share two children. there are many speculated reasons for this split, and none of them are centering around any abuse claims. the reports are vanessa's dislike of his mother, depp became bored, and a potential relationship with amber heard. their relationship did start the same period as depp and paradis's separation. again i will say in this relationship of 14 years, and there were no allegations of abusive behavior. 
amber heard files for divorce under irreconcilable differences on may 23rd,2016, just three days after his mother's death, but this rocky marriage of 15 months has many sides to it. heard was seeking spousal payments and claiming verbal and physical abuse but this divorce and court proceedings go beyond civilized and straight revenge starts. depp's behavior has become erratic throughout their marriage, and his silent cries for help are finally being seen and heard. depp denies all allegations and states he will not respond to lies about his personal life, but this is far from the end.

join us in today‚Äôs video as we share with you the full apology of amber heard. until now, none of either johnny depp's or amber heard's accusations has ever been put before a judge or jury in any court anywhere, or even confirmed by police reports. but with everything that is going on between the two former co-stars and couple, it‚Äôs hard to lose track of how it all started in the first place.

johnny depp and amber heard went their separate ways after the divorce was finalized and it seemed like everything was calming down when heard became romantically attached to billionaire inventor elon musk in the spring of 2017. that relationship, however, was short-lived. because of all these chaos, amber heard has shared her thoughts. be sure to watch the whole video and in addition, do us a favor and like the video and subscribe and turn on the notification bell. we‚Äôll see you in the next video!

johnny had requested for an appeal to open up the case, which last week was denied by the judges. this challenge that johnny offered was rejected by lord justice underhill and lord justice dingemans with their reasoning being that they felt going through the case a second time has a high chance of turning out just like the first one.

depp has been denied the chance to stand up in the libel case against the newspaper as well as one of its journalists. even with him having proof of him being the victim of abuse by amber heard, johnny was facing the brunt. 

lord justice underhill has also stated that it is hard to convince the jury to vote for his side of the case due to the fact that purely factual questions were not enough to turn the case around.

amber had promised to give away the divorce settlement of 7 million dollars that she had received from johnny depp, to two associations one being the aclu and the other being the children‚Äôs hospital, los angeles. 

the truth about this came out when johnny‚Äôs team did some digging and found out that she hadn‚Äôt donated the money and only had contributed $100,000 towards the organizations. 

amber has refuted back that she would pay off the donations in time and that all the money that she had, had gone into the lawsuit case, defending herself. but johnny also did say that the money that she got was being used to sway the judge towards her favour, which is probably what happened. after knowing her nature, it is quite hard to think of her otherwise. 

sadly, johnny cannot go back and fend for himself this time. this is due to the fact that the same crime cannot be tried twice and thus the newspapers have taken a deep breath due to their narrow escape from the case getting messier.

in fact, it was the perfect press strategy. looking at the situation holistically, the overall benefit that amber has is much higher now. but why? well, once one rules you out from being the winner of the case, it is hard for other and judged to not agree with his side of the case too.

what did the sun have to say about this after the verdict was out?
first of all, they were pretty glad that they got out of such a rut of a situation. secondly, the attorney from the sun had stated that the winning of the was a big deal as it was a true representation of how strong amber is to stand up to the face of mr depp. 

this whole situation according to them stood as a great example for those suffering from domestic violence and that they are being heard and must be strong enough to stand up for their rights. 

this libel trial of the century had 12 files of evidence that were looked into with evidence also been taken from around 30 witnesses. the  does not wish to proceed on with this case and is hoping this to be the final end to this prolonged case. 

during the first case that he was involved with, the loss that he endured cost him a major chunk of his career. two of the biggest roles he was holding at that point in time, one being the role of jack sparrow from the pirates of the caribbean and gellert grindelwald from the fantastic beasts franchise, both went down the drain after his loss. 

no one wanted to work with him and ruin the reputation of working with an individual who was involved in domestic abuse. 

the only thing left to look forward to is depp‚Äôs defamation lawsuit that would take place in the united states of america. how that would play out and when it would happen is quite unpredictable at this point in time. 

the pandemic has made things all the more worse by dragging out the events of the case. the case that was to be heard out at in april this year, has been postponed to may next year, which is quite a lot of time.

joelle rich from shilling partners in london has spoken up on behalf of johnny depp stating that he still has hopes of winning. in fact, he still thinks that the in the us may actually see things from his perspective and that he may actually be proved not guilty. amber heard aquaman 2 jason momoa clevver news informoverload amber heard elon musk viral vision

robert downey jr. steps up for johnny depp since disney won't

https://youtu.be/yg2dphn3nse

the fact that johnny depp was fired from his role in the pirates of the caribbean is not
something new. but still, the fans were absolutelly upset and mad as they can't imagine their
favorite movie without johnny. moreover, many people believe that it was just unfair to fire
him as johnny depp has had a long working relationship with disney. the main reason
which made kids‚Äô favorite channel cut ties with johnny was his recent court cases in both the
u.k. and the u.s.. the problems between johnny depp and amber heard made a lot of
mess and as a result, amber‚Äôs allegations of domestic violence and ongoing legal troubles
reportedly cost johnny depp his oscar-nominated, starring role in the multibillion-dollar
grossing pirates of the caribbean franchise.
it‚Äôs been already said a lot about how difficult johnny depp and amber heard‚Äôs break up is
as the nightmare for these two began in 2016. since that year they've been legally fighting
against each other, accusing each other in inappropriate behavior, violence,
libel and many other things. moreover, 2020 wasn't really easy for johnny depp. it was full
of libel trials against news group newspapers, the publisher of the sun, in court over a
2018 article in which they called him a ""wife beater"". during the trial depp denied he's being
violent to amber and also accused heard of having extra-marital affairs with james franco
and elon musk, which heard also denies. however, no matter how depp tried, the court
ruled against depp in the libel trial.
due to recently highlighted personal issues and allegations made against the famed actor,
depp has been dumped by many major film studios. it all began with the fact depp
announced that he had been 'asked to resign' from his role as grindewald in 'fantastic
beasts 3'. he posted on his instagram: ""i wish to let you know that i have been asked to
resign by warner bros. from my role as grindelwald in 'fantastic beasts' and i have
respected and agreed to that request."" he continued, ""... i intend to prove that the
allegations against me are false,"" depp added. ""my life and career will not be defined by this
moment in time.""
and then walt disney pictures who said ‚Äògoodbye‚Äô to johnny depp. according to a
washington post report, disney is said to have dropped depp from the pirates franchise just
four days after heard‚Äôs incendiary 2018 op-ed in the same publication, in which she claimed,
without naming depp, that she was the victim of domestic violence. depp‚Äôs lawyers claimed
that the actor‚Äôs removal from the multibillion-dollar grossing franchise was because of her
allegations.
in 2018, disney production chief sean bailey confirmed that depp was no longer a part of
the franchise‚Äôs future plans. he told the hollywood reporter, ‚Äúwe want to bring in a new
energy and vitality. i love the pirates movies, but part of the reason writers paul wernick and
rhett reese are so interesting is that we want to give it a kick in the pants. and that‚Äôs what
i‚Äôve tasked them with.‚Äù
moreover, some people think it was not the only reason for disney to ‚Äòbreak up‚Äô johnny
depp. another reason for his removal could be the fact that disney couldn‚Äôt afford him
anymore. according to forbes, depp‚Äôs salary, including a healthy profit percentage, reaches
close to $100 million per pirates film. pirates of the caribbean: dead men tell no tales, the

series‚Äô fifth film, registered a box office haul of almost $800 million, well below the over $1
billion totals of the franchise‚Äôs second and fourth films, and the $963 million haul of the third
one. disney is looking to save $90 million by recasting depp, the report said.
...
now i want to know your opinion. let me know in the comments section down below do you
believe that there‚Äôs a chance for fans to see johnny depp as a captain jack sparrow?

459,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMTaTbtiaR0,0,0,{'EZ Law'},1,youtube,video,original video,"in 2020, johnny depp lost his libel case against news group newspapers who produce the sun. depp claimed the sun's article in 2018 which claimed he was a wife-beater and had abused amber heard, was false. 

many were confused when the high court ruled against johnny depp, even though there was proof that amber heard had assaulted him. a voice recording surfaced of the pair talking and heard admits to hitting depp. many called for amber heard to go to jail and the hashtag #justiceforjohnnydepp began trending.

however, a lot of people have misunderstood the case. despite involving domestic abuse, this was not a criminal trial but a libel trial. this means neither amber heard or johnny depp were on trial. johnny depp was only suing the sun and amber heard was simply a witness to help the sun's case.

unlike in a criminal trial where one must prove guilt 'beyond reasonable doubt', in this libel case the sun only had to prove it was 'more likely than not' that what they had reported was true; that depp had abused amber heard.

apology video
when amber heard smuggled their two pet dogs to australia, which goes against the country‚Äôs laws- the pair came out with an apology video to address the situation. but, to a lot of people the video seemed weird. although it was heard herself who did the activity, depp appeared to be quite off in the video and some even remarked that it looked like he was being forced to show up in front of the camera. we will let you be the judge of it.

premiere of alice through the looking glass
in 2016, when johnny and amber‚Äôs divorce were in the works, he attended a movie premiere at london. when asked if he had any message for his fans, depp said some lines that sounded extremely weird and even funny to his fans and the audience. however, when we look back now- the message seems almost cryptic, as if he was trying to ask for help. watch the interview for yourself.

.... why would 2 years ago, an alleged romantic partner of ex-staff of depp send a photo of missing anthony fox - going to testify against johnny depp - state amber was kicked multiple times, that they are threatened with death, & do so under a locked account?
 
why would reporters - including rachel abrams of the new york times attacked by faceless-bot like adam waldman account - never write a story? rachel abrams was involved with cambridge analytica reporting according to thegeekbuzz.com

why do social platforms ignore stopping threats against #amberheard, her witnesses, & supporters, as if 'fake jack sparrow' of 2019 at facebook ai/ml training was self-fulfilling prophecy?
why does anonymouswordwide.com never post edited audio of #rosemcgowan, who said agents were used to stop reporters from reporting on weinstein and twitter locked her account in 2017? ""bots are agents.""

top 10 celebrities who defended johnny depp

https://youtu.be/uj9kutxlulw

the never ending fight between johnny depp and amber heard seems to last forever. every
day the press reveals new facts and new details about the situation but no one knows how it
all going to end and who is the victim and who is the liar. but the only thing which left for us -
is to analyze the facts. after ex-wife amber heard accused him of committing domestic
violence during their marriage, multiple celebrities with ties to johnny depp have come
forward in his defense. this is really impressive but depp‚Äôs other ex-wife and mother of his
two children, vanessa paradis, depp‚Äôs ex-fiance winona ryder, and his former co-star
penelope cruz have all testified in the actor‚Äôs defense. it should be noted that though all
three women insist depp was never violent in their presence, the only ones for certain who
know the intimate details of heard and depp‚Äôs marriage are depp and heard. anyways, let‚Äôs
listen to what many celebrities had to say about the entire situation and why they defend
johnny depp.
10. winona ryder
winona ryder is the blast, depp‚Äôs edward scissorhands‚Äò co-star and his ex-girlfriend. she
declared that she had never experienced any of the behavior that heard detailed. she said:
‚Äúfrom my experience, which was so wildly different, i was absolutely shocked, confused and
upset when i heard the accusations against him.‚Äù ryder continued as part of her statement
in defense of depp‚Äôs character, ‚Äúthe idea that he is an incredibly violent person is the
farthest thing from johnny i knew and loved. i cannot wrap my head around these
accusations.‚Äù winona ryder went on to say that johnny depp was ‚Äúnever, never‚Äù violent or
abusive towards her or ‚Äútowards anybody i have seen.‚Äù she also said that she‚Äôd always ‚Äúfelt
so very, very safe with him.‚Äù
9. sharon osbourne
speaking on us daytime hit the talk, sharon compared the pair's relationship to her violent
marriage to ozzy saying: ""she gave him as good as she got."" the former x factor judge
said: ""do you know what i think? it takes two to tango. i think they had a very vulnerable
relationship. i think they're both as bad as each other."" sharon continued: ""she gave him as
good as she got. it wasn't just like a little mouse in the corner being battered. she gave him
back. speaking about depp and heard on the talk this week, sharon insisted: ""if there is
enough love you work through it with help. but there obviously wasn't that love to keep them
together. ""he was defending himself, she was defending herself. whatever went on only
those two know. they both hurt each other‚Äù.
8. laura wasser
depp‚Äôs high-powered divorce attorney laura wasser, who has also represented clients like
agelina jolie and allegedly works with kim kardashian, responded to heard‚Äôs restraining
order request in court documents, saying the actress is ‚Äúattempting to secure a premature
financial resolution by alleging abuse.‚Äù ‚Äúher current application for a temporary restraining
order along with her financial requests appears to be in response to the negative media
attention she received earlier this week after filing for divorce,‚Äù wasser wrote. ‚Äúyet johnny
cannot protect himself or amber from media scrutiny, and amber‚Äôs anger certainly cannot

drive this dissolution proceeding.‚Äù wasser also alleges that heard took advantage of depp at
an emotional time ‚Äì his mother having died three days before heard filed for divorce on
monday.
7. laurie holden
walking dead star laurie holden defended depp on twitter, in an ‚Äúimpassioned reaction to
the vilification of a human being on social media and the public outcry for complete and utter
rumination.‚Äù
‚Äúi, for one, am going to see johnny depp‚Äôs new movie,‚Äù the 46-year-old actress tweeted
about alice through the looking glass. ‚Äúhis personal life is just that. personal. no one
knows the real truth so just zip it.‚Äù ‚Äúto be clear: i am just saying don‚Äôt jump to
conclusions,‚Äù she added. ‚Äúeven a pic might not be telling the whole story....‚Äù
...

we know that both are the dc royalties with such powerful and fierce roles but despite this they haven‚Äôt shared the screen yet.
according to dnaniel richtman, gal gadot is eager to work with amber heard in the dceu. if the wonder woman is eager to work with heard and this leaked news is true then we will get to see some great some stuff where both these badass princesses will kick some ass. 
we can also maybe see rivalry as both altanteans and amzoneans share a long history of conflict in dceu comics. 
as aquaman 2 is in pre-production so we might not see them sharing a scene this soon, but we might see a scene between them in future dc movies slash series.
it was also rumored that emilia clark will replace amber heard‚Äôs role as princess mera. and the great khal‚Äôs great khaleesi is getting more support for this role to see the great chemistry again. depp‚Äôs fans signed a petition to warner bros with over a million signs. yes!! a million signs just to replace amber heard.

heard used to act in well-directed independent movies and gained fame but her actual turning point was her portrayal of queen mera in justice league which she went ahead with, in the aquaman movie also. 

it was one of the highest-grossing films in 2018 and she gained international recognition because of that role. she even was nominated as a global spokesperson for l'oreal paris. she even dated elon musk for a year until early 2018!

amber heard had things going good for her until the controversy struck and her whole career braked to a halt over allegations that she abused depp and he was the victim of abuse during their marriage.

the entirety of hollywood was split into two, one favoring her and one favoring her ex-husband during this scandal. when she stepped out as a victim of marital abuse, she got a lot of support and concern from all fans. 

sympathy went to depp and most of the production houses didn't want any of them to be broiled in controversy after casting. heard lost her role in aquaman 2 and expressed her deep disappointment and depp stepped down from his role as grindelwald in the crimes of grindelwald movie of the fantastic beasts franchise. 

johnny depp was first married to lori allison and later got engaged to jennifer grey but finally proposed to winona ryder who was his co-star. he was so obsessed with her, he tattooed ‚Äúwinona forever‚Äù on his right arm. 

but that didn‚Äôt work out and he instead hit it up with vanessa paradis and has two children with her. paradise and he separated in 2012 and then walked amber heard into his life.

amber heard was dating tasya van ree in the 2010s and they broke up in 2011. there was a charge against her for misdemeanor and domestic violence, but ree later said that it was just over-sensationalized.heard met depp in 2012 on the sets of a movie and they dated and even lived together for three years. they then got married in 2015. 

within 7 months, in 2016, they filed for divorce. but it wasn‚Äôt just divorce, she pressed charges against him for verbal and physical abuse under alcohol influence. 

heard went ahead to release pictures and evidence of her abuse which garnered more outrage. they alleged that their relationship was passionate and volatile but forever bound by love. they said that they did not do this for the money and yet, johnny depp had to pay heard an amount of 7 million us dollars, which she donated to the children's hospital in los angeles.

fans thought that was it, everything had settled, but heard published an op-ed in the washington post where the narrative was about her as an abuse victim. it did not mention depp in any way, yet he took action and slapped a libel case on her. in a huge twist, he accused heard of physical abuse, provided evidence, and said that all her claims were a hoax.

this was all that depp wanted, he started to sue all the articles that labeled him a ‚Äúwife-beater‚Äù and other claims but the high court of justice voted in heard‚Äôs favor and said that his claims of the whole thing being a hoax was not justified. depp decided to appeal the decision and in order to give his all for it, decided to step down from his role in crimes of grindelwald and was replaced by mads mikkelsen. boycott amber heard

after the call by the actor to contest heard's claim, fans showed massive response by flooding twitter with deppmovienight and deppcember where they organized a 24-hour movie marathon to show westandwithjohnnydepp.

due to their massive activism in depp's aspect, they generated an online petition to get heard removed from aquaman 2 which succeeded and she was very heartbroken about it. such was the huge controversy in johnny depp's life. 

the mic drop comes because amber heard's lawyers quit. this was quite the turnaround as at this crucial junction it is unheard of for lawyers of great distinction to quit. roberta kaplan is a high-profile lawyer and her withdrawal from the case and letting heard take up the services of another counsel called elaine bredehoft from virginia is quite shocking. depp seems to be moving on and has the case to persist in the case. depp's defamation lawsuit against heard will be commenced in the spring of 2021.  clevver news  johnny depp amber heard  amber heard aquaman 2

‚ñ∫thanks to my patrons! danielle moore nazzaria grendanin jazmyn lynn queen james johnson ---------------------------------- 
editing details: creating aquaman 2 was challenging because i was not into this franchsie. but my dc lover side made me appreciate this film more. i watched this film once and i thought it was decent. the fresh clips are not too hard to find since there are plenty of cosplay to chose from. to avoid making this dream trailer feel low budget i chose clips from the aquaman movie it self. such as the atlantic city. the music was great, despite the lack of humor the soundtrack by the equalizer 2 trailer #2 was great because it had lots of trailer fling to it. the main actor himself had lots of movies to chose from since this is the first time i made a project about him. not the first aquaman project though, i did one back in 2020 for one of the trailer style of the infinity saga. the line ""is only a myth"" is great connection to how aquaman is a mystical character. the film see had great lines talking about ""gods"" that perfectly fits this dream trailer. speaking of perfectly fits, the clip with aquaman attacks the bad guy we get a transition to a guy getting attacked in the water.

so we guess most of you guys know about the messy divorce case that took place between hollywood superstar johnny depp and the gorgeous amber heard. ever since the proceedings of the divorce took place in 2016, johnny‚Äôs name in the industry has constantly been deteriorating while her name kept rising amongst the ranks of other film stars. 

in complete honesty, no one knew who amber heard was. many film stars from the industry have also claimed of not knowing her until her infamous divorce case was the talk of the town. 

do you guys want to know a certain bunch of deals she struck after her gruesome divorce?
well, for starters she was hired by the warner bros to play the role of mera in aquaman which was such a big deal for her as she had been playing smaller roles till then. this was also accompanied by her being the spokesperson of loreal paris, the world-renowned cosmetics brand.

so, what exactly caused her career to come crashing down?
not going to lie, but all the virtual rotten tomatoes that are being thrown at her by the public after the truth about her actions was out, was completely her fault. amber heard had strategically planned all her moves carefully all along. she had the prime goal of ruining johnny‚Äôs life as well as career, probably for his money as he was once worth 400 million dollars which kept deteriorating till it touched 150 million dollars as of now and is still dwindling due to the massive amounts he has to pay.

so, what exactly is the 50 million dollar johnny depp filed against amber heard, and what are the consequences that she may face in case johnny wins?
long story short, johnny cut the chase and brought out evidence of leaked audiotapes and text messages that clearly displayed amber to have abused him.

in the case of amber being accused guilty, she would have to face a minimum of 3 years in prison for the reason of manipulation of evidence as well as for defaming her ex-husband. in addition to all of this, there are two petitions out in the open that are gaining a massive inflow of signatures on change.org, one of them holding the goal to remove her from being cast in aquaman 2.  

after the divorce with the me too movement blowing up, of which johnny was a major victim, johnny was losing roles, losing money, and losing fame. he even gave out a statement that he was attracted to her for beauty and actually thought she was a supportive woman but only a while later did he notice that she was only with him for the fame and the money. this is also probably why she struck a major deal with the dc movie aquaman quite easily. i think with that being said, it is safe enough to say that amber heard was truly a golddigger, not only for his money but was out to get his fame too.

but what has amber heard said about these claims?
first of all, amber is a professional liar and that is something we all can agree on now. she has constantly been refuting the truth by stating that the accusations were false and that the world is just going against her based on some false facts.

in fact, she even went out to lie about her divorce settlement. while she received her divorce settlement for 7 million dollars, she openly claimed that she didn‚Äôt want to keep the money of an individual who is involved in domestic abuse and even stated she would donate them to two organizations one being aclu and the children's hospital los angeles. the truth did come out that she did not fulfill her promise to both the organizations and just gave a mere few thousands out of the millions that she inherited. 

so back to the latest news about her, is she being kicked out of aquaman‚Äôs sequel?
warner bros have been quiet about this, but the latest reports have stated that she didn‚Äôt pass the physical exam which she is to pass as mentioned in the contract. due to her being out of shape, the movie may outcast her if she doesn‚Äôt fix it quickly.  jason momoa

jason momoa is a name that is buzzing and has been buzzing in the world of showbiz for quite some time. in fact, when aquaman was released earlier in the year 2018, he was the only talk of hollywood! following that, he was given the opportunity to play a variety of roles in different movies leaving us to wonder when we would see this heartthrob on the big screens again!

due to aquaman‚Äôs major success, soon after its release, the second sequel to the movie was announced to be premiered in the year 2022. unfortunately, with the me too movement targeting so many a-listers, one of the cast members was accused of being a part of this bandwagon. any guesses on who fell off the wagon and joined in amongst the list of abusers? yes, it was amber heard!

amber heard has been making headlines regularly for almost 2 years now, especially after her divorce from johnny depp. initially, people assumed her to be the poor victim in the chaotic scenario she had going on with johnny depp. at one point, we were pretty convinced that she was the victim after she posted her pictures of the scars that she had obtained due to being a victim of domestic violence. 
 
what were amber‚Äôs claims?

amber heard proved to be the biggest victim of the year, with her constant rants on social media as well as her claiming johnny depp to be an evil man with anger issues. she kept throwing out lies until one day depp was forced to sue her, hence causing the famous chaotic court case to make repeated headlines.

how did ambers claims backfire?
 
johnny depp was proven innocent to his ex-wife‚Äôs claims after a leaked conversation between the two was released, proving that in fact, it was johnny depp who was being victimized. this surely didn‚Äôt save the mess he was in but made the likes of big platforms such as disney apologize to him for believing the allegations.

how did this news worsen?

the me too movement was trending and each day a new celeb was being called out for inappropriate behaviour of misconduct with the co-workers, especially the female ones. due to this being embedded in the minds of all, depp was the most likely candidate to get abuser-bashed for his immoral actions.

due to her alleged accusations, johnny depp‚Äôs career was quite miserable. in fact, the production teams that loved working with his massive talent started to reject his role in the movies. and all this was due to the fault of amber and her bunch of lies. imagine not having jack sparrow in the next pirates of the caribbean sequel!

was momoa and heard compatible in real life as much as they seemed on screen?

rumor has it that the momoa and heard were not as compatible as they seemed on the screen. with them being actors from two different worlds, it is sure to be quite a clash in the studios. but others state that they were actually good together since they were complete opposites and that opposites attract. even though they seem great together on the red carpet, always having fun, the truth behind this fact is still left unknown!

would momoa‚Äôs word and stance on this scenario change the fate of who plays the role of mera?

most probably, yes. without jason, there is no aquaman. in fact, the entire success behind aquaman was 90% due to jason momoa‚Äôs efforts in making the storyline as lively. without him, reaching this milestone would have been highly impossible. on a serious note, it‚Äôs highly possible that rather than risking their biggest asset, warner bros. would not sacrifice their king for the sake of amber! clevver news celebrity news amber heard aquaman 2 johnny depp elon musk amber heard fight video top 10

it looks like all those petitions to remove amber heard from aquaman 2 may have finally paid off, as a new report suggests warner bros. has dropped the actress from james wan‚Äôs upcoming sequel. a couple of weeks ago, heard lost the appeal to dismiss johnny depp‚Äôs $50 million defamation lawsuit and we learned that the aquaman star could be facing up to 3 years of jail time if found guilty of manipulating evidence against her then-husband. but even beyond the former couple‚Äôs seemingly never-ending legal battle, heard has come under a lot of fire after evidence presented to the court as part of the lawsuit revealed that she‚Äôs physically and emotionally harassed depp while twisting the narrative in her favor and painting the pirates of the caribbean actor as a domestic abuser.

in his witness statement, johnny depp said amber heard was trying to be a ""carbon copy"" of him to make him fall for her. well, she is diagnosed with borderline/narcissistic personality disorder, and we all know narcs steal other people's personalities (especially the good ones) because they don't have a personality of their own.

when i saw the way she approaches the people in that video, i couldn't not think of how this has always been something jd does with his fans (tries to approach them when his security guards pull him away) and how she always wanted to be/look like him, so i made this video to show you all how she pretends to be him even in the simplest things, and what a bad actress she really is.

johnny depp has simply had enough now! earlier johnny said that he has not been hurt like this before as allegations struck a major blow to his reputation and mental health, but as soon as amber heard started targeting his kids, then johnny had to put a stop for her! and so do we, emotionally blackmail his kids is just wrong! 

first of all, then johnny has since the start of the controversy said that amber heard has made several false and unproven reports about his extravagant spending, his legal disputes with his former managers and a rolling stone profile which portrayed him as a debauched, self-indulgent and narcissistic. she has also said that johnny would be ready to fight till his demise if anyone targets his children. anyways, amber seems to have forgotten that, since she herself has just started targeting johnny's kids. 
johnny himself doesn‚Äôt even hide the fact. once, he even said that he would bite off the nose of anyone who nears his kids.

in hollywood, scandals, break-ups, divorces, and gossip are nothing new. one such news that has taken away the thunder of the other news and buzz is the divorce and the legal battle of johnny depp and amber heard.

the legal battle between amber heard and johnny depp has been going on for years. it started in 2016, just a year after their marriage and since then, it hasn‚Äôt had closure. but do you know, what is one thing that seems repetitive throughout this? it is the passing of blames and tampering evidence. 

recently, a subpoena emerged and it suggested that it was addressed to amber heard‚Äôs sister whitney henriquez. the fans conjectured that something which whitney must have said would have been a lie and that amber had urged her to do so. as a result, she was asked to appear before the court. isn‚Äôt this tampering evidence? the case is unending because of these games that have been played by amber heard. 

throughout the years of the legal battle between amber heard and johnny depp, there have been so many celebrities that pointed out the elephant in the room - the idea that amber heard could be the  and liar all these years. all while, the audience kept blaming johnny depp. 

let us go about the celebrities who spoke up against amber and what their opinions are. 

the first celebrity that we are going to talk about is johnny depp‚Äôs ex-partner - vanessa paradis.  vanessa paradis defends johnny in court and raises serious questions doubting the allegations made against johnny depp by amber heard. according to vanessa, johnny is a kind, attentive, generous, and  partner and a father.",21.0,598.0,,,,,,570.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,top celebrities who spoke up against amber heard's lies,,,,,,,,,,

‚Ä¢ adventure, drama, fantasy

‚Ä¢ stars: whoopi goldberg, alexander skarsg√•rd, james marsden, amber heard 
‚Ä¢ imdb: 5,5/10

the stand episode 8 release date
‚Äòthe stand‚Äô episode 8 is scheduled to premiere on february 4, 2021, on cbs all access at 3 am et. the miniseries is slated to have a total of nine episodes.

spoilers ‚Äòthe stand‚Äô is also titled ‚Äòthe stand.‚Äô it is the penultimate episode of the limited series. if the show follows the stephen king book closely, then the upcoming episode will see glen executed by lloyd after he denies bending his knee to randall flagg. the episode may also see a dying nadine prophetically telling flagg that four men from boulder would be his end. in the book, a livid flagg tosses nadine from the penthouse balcony, thus killing her instantly. the next episode might also see the trashcan man return with the nuclear weapon that flagg wanted.

titled ‚Äúthe stand,‚Äù the stand season 1 episode 8 is soon going to be released. the post-apocalyptic fiction has been getting mixed reviews since its premiere. this show is based on a book penned down by stephen king. it went by the same name and was published back in 1978. the makers took very long to realize that the book is worth having a tv adaptation.

the stand s01e08: in a world mostly wiped out by the plague and embroiled in an elemental struggle between good and evil, the fate of mankind rests on the frail shoulders of the 108-year-old mother abagail and a handful of survivors. their worst nightmares are embodied in a man with a lethal smile and unspeakable powers: randall flagg, the dark man.

the stand is a post-apocalyptic dark fantasy novel written by american author stephen king and first published in 1978 by doubleday. the plot centers on a pandemic of a weaponized strain of influenza that kills almost the entire world population. the few survivors, united in groups, establish a new social system and engage in confrontation with each other. in writing the book, king sought to create an epic in the spirit of the lord of the rings that was set in contemporary america. the book was difficult for king to write because of the large number of characters and storylines.

in 1990, the stand was reprinted as a complete and uncut edition. king restored some fragments of texts that were initially reduced, revised the order of the chapters, shifted the novel's setting from 1980 to 10 years forward, and accordingly corrected a number of cultural references. the complete and uncut edition of the stand is considered to be king's longest stand-alone work with its 1,152 pages, surpassing king's 1,138-page novel it. the book has sold 4.5 million copies.

top 10 celebrities who tried to warn us about amber heard

https://youtu.be/ofo6smjgjhc

few celebrity breakups are as controversial as the ever-unfolding drama between johnny
depp and amber heard. most people i know are either ‚Äúteam johnny‚Äù or ‚Äúteam amber,‚Äù
and they‚Äôve spent a lot of time discussing who the real abuser in the troubled relationship
must have been. however, johnny depp was trying to warn everyone about amber heard
and who she is for real.
over the past several months, we‚Äôve heard from depp‚Äôs friends, fans, and exes who all claim
he could have never mistreated amber because of his sweet and gentle nature. and there
have been many doubts cast upon heard, leading people to think she‚Äôs the core abuser, a
narcissistic gold digger, and ultimately, a liar. adding to this we have johnny depp‚Äôs hints
and attempts to tell the truth about his ex wife.
amber heard is not an obvious abuser
we like to imagine that the real abuser is always some sort of obvious monster, and that
we‚Äôre not going to be manipulated by any wolves in sheep‚Äôs clothing. do you remember that
‚Äòmessage‚Äô to johnny depp‚Äôs fans when he was ‚Äòjokingly‚Äô saying: ‚Äúi‚Äôm scared to death, i‚Äôm
frightened and i don‚Äôt know what to do, i am confused and i want to go home‚Äù. this phrase
made everyone laugh but what if it was johnny‚Äôs cry for help? he couldn‚Äôt tell anyone what
was going on between him and amber heard (before the legal fight) as he is a good person
and he didn‚Äôt want to show people their dirty laundry.
amber heard pretended to be a victim
the myth of the obvious abuser was very convenient for amber heard and of course
eventually it did more harm than good, even for amber. people easily wind up defending
their guilty friends and blaming the victims. we might mistake self-defense and coping
mechanisms by victims as ""proof"" of their crimes. victims of domestic violence may even
use violence themselves against their abusers, and it can be very difficult for outsiders to
establish which person is the primary abuser and which person is the primary victim. johnny
depp was trying to warn everyone she was a liar but he couldn‚Äôt prove he wasn‚Äôt guilty.
amber heard had a strong tactic - to lie in a court. but eventually body language experts
analysed the video back in 2016 court deposition. first everyone thought amber heard
behaved really weird because she was stressed and scared. but according to body
language experts, she just behaved like a typical liar.
severed finger
being a real man johnny depp didn‚Äôt tell anyone what happened with his finger for real and
was even trying to hide the facts and lied to his friends about the incident! obviously, he
wanted to protect amber heard. during the venice film festival 2015 conference dakota
johnson obviously asked johnny depp about his finger, johnny answered vaguely, he
avoided the question with the joke but it seems dakota didn‚Äôt believe him. she knew:
something was wrong. just notice, dakota gave him a look that says that she knows more
than he lets on.

amber heard made him lie for her
you may remember the story about amber heard‚Äôs dogs and that she had some problems
with them. in july 2015 amber heard brought yorkshire terriers pistol and boo to the
country illegally. and to avoid problems amber heard asked her former employee kevin
murphy to lie under oath after she was charged with bringing her two dogs to australia
illegally. murphy claimed heard pressured him to commit perjury about the travelling terriers
or risk losing his job. ‚Äúshe wanted me to say essentially that it was my fault in one way or
another that the paperwork wasn‚Äôt completed, so that i could take the blame for her,‚Äù murphy
said. and of course, she asked johnny depp to help with this problem. isn‚Äôt it a warning sign
of ab**se? but probably johnny depp had to go along with everything amber wanted
because he truly loved her. but she literally forced johnny to help her with the problem and
he got in trouble as a result.

______________________________________________
amber heard has condemned the media for ‚Äúignoring‚Äù allegations against the rock star marilyn manson, who has been accused by a number of women of abuse. 

in today's video we are going to discuss about amber heard calls out media for ‚Äòignoring‚Äô marilyn manson abuse allegations. 

on monday (1 february), actor evan rachel wood accused manson of grooming and abusing her ‚Äúfor years‚Äù while they were in a relationship. several other women also came forward with allegations against manson.at least 10 women, including actor evan rachel wood, have spoken out against manson since monday, making allegations that include sexual assault, psychological abuse, physical violence and anti-semitism. manson has denied the accusations, calling them ‚Äúhorrible distortions of reality.‚Äù 

on thursday (4 february), heard, who has been embroiled in a high-profile divorce battle with johnny depp, tweeted her support of wood, while suggesting that the media had long turned a blind eye to manson‚Äôs behaviour.sharing an article from the new yorker suggesting there is a ‚Äúblind spot‚Äù when it comes to allegations made against public figures, heard wrote: ‚Äú...and yet, no one sees the trend here? everyone wants to tag a bathroom wall, no one wants to understand the writing. evan & i aren‚Äôt the 1st to raise our hands. are you done ignoring it?‚Äù 

after a twitter user replied to heard‚Äôs message with the single word ‚Äúfraud‚Äù, heard responded: ‚Äúwell i know a couple of over-indulged white male celebrities (who happen to be world famous) and single, who are def in the market for some low rate ass-missing [sic], shall i intro you??‚Äù 

earlier this week (2 february), heard‚Äôs ex-husband depp was permitted an oral hearing in his attempts to appeal a ruling by the british high court over a newspaper column that described him as a ‚Äúwife beater‚Äù. the hearing will be held in march.heard has long accused the pirates of the caribbean star of domestic violence, something he has denied. after suing the sun publisher news group newspapers and its executive editor dan wootton for referring to him as a ‚Äúwife beater‚Äù in a column, depp lost the case in december. a british judge declared that the claim was ‚Äúsubstantially true.""

in court filings, heard alleged depp, one of manson‚Äôs close friends, was verbally and physically abusive to her. in 2016, people magazine published photos that showed heard with a ‚Äúbruised eye and cut lip‚Äù stemming from an alleged domestic violence incident involving depp in december 2015. heard said she ‚Äútruly feared for her life‚Äù during that incident. in november, a british judge ruled against depp in his libel lawsuit against a british newspaper that called him a ‚Äúwife beater.‚Äù heard testified in the case, alleging depp repeatedly assaulted her, including head-butting her, hitting her and tearing out clumps of her hair. 

a petition to remove heard from the aquaman franchise, spearheaded by depp‚Äôs fans, has so far received millions of signatures.heard condemned the campaign, while arguing that it will have no effect on her status within the superhero franchise. ‚Äúpaid rumours and paid campaigns on social media don‚Äôt dictate [casting decisions] because they have no basis in reality,‚Äù heard said in november.

the case between amber heard and johnny depp is one that people all over the world are becoming familiar with. amber heard is presenting herself to be in a bad situation that might be pretty hard to come back from. someone also involved in this case is the tesla billionaire, elon musk. allow me to explain why elon musk is now a person of interest in this whole drama.

according to the times-news source, johnny depp has appeared to have dragged elon musk into the amber heard saga. just a couple of days ago it was stated that the tesla billionaire is being brought back into depp‚Äôs 50 million dollar libel action against his ex-wife, amber. what some of you might not know is why. well, depp who had accused elon of having an affair with amber during their short-lasting marriage is bringing him back into the case again. however, johnny depp is bringing elon into the mix for a different reason. depp wants elon to be interviewed and in this interview, depp would like him to come forward and hand over the details of all the contact he has had with amber heard. the 57-year-old actor is suing her for 50 million dollars in virginia over a 2019 op-ed article she wrote for the washington post. in the article, amber described herself as a victim. most of you might be aware of this, but the news about elon being brought into the case really changes the game as there could be some new information that elon could bring forward in order to either help depp‚Äôs case against amber heard or the other way around. johnny depp has obtained a court order requiring elon musk, the 49-year-old ceo to give his testimony. this is where he will be questioned on the details about his relationship with amber heard. the reason for him being called forward is not to talk about their relationship or whatever they shared together, but musk is being asked to come forward and bring forward any knowledge he has of her allegations against her ex-husband, johnny depp. this means that if he is aware of what the truth is in this case. musk may be the one who holds some useful information that can make or break the case for either of the two. depp is hoping that he comes forward and discusses the truth of what happened and not the lies that are being constantly spread. elon is known for several different things, one of which is that he is the ceo of spacex, and the other being that he is the ceo of tesla. musk, who was estimated last month to be the world‚Äôs richest person with a worth of more than 185 billion dollars, is being required to provide details of phone calls, emails, letters, and text messages exchanged with amber heard during various periods in march 2015. now, you may be thinking that this is invading elon‚Äôs privacy but there are legitimate reasons behind it. back when things were not so good between amber heard and johnny depp, it was stated that she was going to get a restraining order against depp. when amber decided to do this, the one she made sure to let know was elon musk. as she went on to tell him about the issue, he offered to pay and provide her with 24-hour security. he also shared that he liked amber heard, according to what the high court had to hear. laws said that musk offers to arrange 24/7 security for you, adding the offer would stand even if you never wanted to see me again. anyway, sorry for being an idiot. the radio silence hurts a lot. it only matters because i really like you, said elon. he has also been asked to hand over any documents relating to her 7 million dollar divorce settlement which she claimed to have donated to the american civil liberties union and the children‚Äôs hospital los angeles. the money that she in fact came forward to state that she had yet to give her settlement money over as it was promised back when she split with depp.in other news, back when johnny depp unsuccessfully sued the sun over an article describing him in a not-so-kind manner and questioning why j.k rowling let him appear in the fantastic beasts‚Äô film because of the allegations amber heard stated about depp.the high court was told that elon musk became a regular late-night visitor to amber heard monthly.

have passionate sex scene (amber heard  and alexander skarsg√•rd)
making love scene from series: ""the stand"" (2021)


‚Ä¢ original title: ""the stand""
‚Ä¢ episode title (s01e07) ""episode 7""
‚Ä¢ adventure, drama, fantasy 
‚Ä¢ creators: josh boone, benjamin cavell
‚Ä¢ stars: whoopi goldberg, alexander skarsg√•rd, james marsden 
‚Ä¢ imdb: 5,5/10


the stand picks up the pace significantly in a crucial episode directed with flair and dread by vincenzo natali (splice, cube). there are still some odd changes to the source material in this hour.


how is nadine not in vegas yet? wasn‚Äôt she going 120 mph? anyway, she finds a red carpet in the desert, and she‚Äôs suddenly in flagg‚Äôs penthouse. she made it. she‚Äôs finally with her king. they kiss, and she tells him about harold. now she can be his wife, and the two have passionate sex that gets more and more intense. she starts to sense something isn‚Äôt right and realizes she‚Äôs still in the desert just as she suddenly sees a demon form of flagg. it‚Äôs an odd, vague cut to commercial in that shocking moment that somewhat lessens one of the darkest scenes in stephen king history. in the book, this is a brutal, violent rape scene (‚Äúhe battered into her, invader, destroyer, and the cold blood gushed down her thighs‚Äù) that traumatizes nadine and leaves her catatonic. it may have been too dark for cbs all access, but the way it‚Äôs framed here feels like it mutes how much flagg abuses even his ‚Äúqueen.‚Äù


by this time, nadine has finally reached the next phase of her destiny. flagg transports her to his suite in new vegas, where he has sex with her. it‚Äôs all a beautiful illusion, though, as nadine realizes too late. the edges of the fantasy dissolve to reveal that she‚Äôs lying in the dirt, and flagg is a demon. and while this scene also shifts to imply that nadine is no longer consenting, it is an improvement upon the scene in the book, which is a violent rape scene.


nadine is simultaneously reluctant and determined to get to flagg, enticed of his protection and terrified of his ownership of her. she willingly goes, but it‚Äôs also the result of years and years of conditioning on flagg‚Äôs part. he shrunk her world so that it seemed like he was the only person she had. he made her need him. she starts to have sex with him and then tries to stop, but he ignores her protests, and things turn violent and terrifying. she sees him for the monster he really is, but it‚Äôs too late. he sucks everything out of her so that she becomes a floating, quiet, submissive shell. she has served her purpose: she‚Äôs pregnant with flagg‚Äôs demon baby, and it‚Äôs literally sucking the life out of her. flagg‚Äôs at his scariest here. his behaviors with nadine have all the markings of an abusive, manipulative, all-consuming relationship.


it goes both ways, too. as already mentioned, harold understands in his last minutes that it was his inability to let go of his humiliation and hatred that has doomed him, and once nadine gets to the desert, she too has an awful moment of clarity when she and flagg bang it out. even mother abigail chastises herself for the sinful pride that caused her to forget that, ‚Äúi was not the potter, but the clay.‚Äù as this series creeps toward the final showdown, cavell and his writers are making it clear that the bigger battle for humanity‚Äôs salvation is already underway, and the lines there for which side one should be on are as clear as day.


‚Äúthe walk‚Äù works as well as it does because it manages to pull these character and thematic moments together in an episode that is also captivating, and is bolstered by some gorgeous cinematography capturing the quartet‚Äôs walk west (and a clutch use of radiohead‚Äôs ‚Äúi promise‚Äù during one such portion). the performances of marsden, adepo, kinnear, and bedard represent an emotional high-water mark for the series, with all four actors using the history of the previous six episodes to fall into an effortless rapport as a group.


on the flipside, like harold‚Äôs motorcycle, teague hits a wall with his performance this time around, as his magnificent crescendo in last week‚Äôs ‚Äúthe vigil‚Äù didn‚Äôt leave him anywhere to go in the early moments of this episode. and while nadine‚Äôs lightening-fast gestation of flagg‚Äôs demon-baby does hit the whole, ‚Äúthe future is what you make of it‚Äù theme a little too squarely on the head, her corpse-like complexion at the end of the episode.

2020 has not been an easy year for anyone especially not for johnny depp. from his loss against the high-profile libel case involving the sun and his ex-wife amber heard, one can say that depp has really been in an intense battle throughout the year. however one thing that is looking good for depp is the support that he has been receiving from millions, even including the support of some big name celebrities. for quite some time people were slowly starting to believe amber heard but that was only until an audio was leaked that quickly made people say she was the guilty one in this situation. there are so many scandals in the celebrity world but this is one that is causing quite the uproar as people are striving to bring justice to johnny depp. allow us to break down the details of the scandal, but also provide you with a list of those celebrities who are supporting depp during this time. 

could it actually be true that johnny depp is the one who is innocent in this entire situation? why would amber heard spread and display such false allegations about him? if johnny depp truly is innocent then, will amber heard be at risk of losing her status? is there any way for her to defend herself after the audios that have been leaked? let us know what you think in the comments down below!

it seems as though emilia clarke might have signed in to replace amber heard in aquaman 2, which comes from a recent article in forbes. game of thrones star emilia clarke suits up as mera to replace amber heard in a stunning new concept design for aquaman 2.

in this video we will be discussing the replacement of amber heard in aquaman 2 by emilia clarke. 

johnny depp was forced to step away from his role as the main villain of the fantastic beasts series after losing his libel case related to the abuse allegations made by his ex-wife amber heard. since depp alleged that heard was also physically and emotionally abusive towards him in their relationship, many fans would like the aquaman star to leave her role as the comic book icon mera in the dc extended universe movies. while it would probably be easier for aquaman 2 to just jettison the character entirely, some suggested emilia clarke to take over the role of mera as a way for the sequel to move forward without any story-related issues.

digital artist bosslogic took the idea and ran with it. in his latest concept, bosslogic reveals what emilia clarke could look like as mera for aquaman 2. it‚Äôs hard to deny that the former game of thrones star looks the part, as the new outfit the artist puts her in immediately gives her a regal look. clarke‚Äôs acting talents would definitely be a big step up for the dceu and game of thrones fans would be wholly excited to see the british star reunite with jason momoa. 

from what we‚Äôve gathered in the last several months, amber heard is returning to make aquaman 2 and warner bros. is not inclined to get rid of her. she is a domestic abuse survivor in their eyes and worthy of a spinoff film, especially when dc films doesn‚Äôt have as many leading female action heroes as marvel. a petition calling for heard to be fired and replaced with emilia clarke keeps gaining signatures but heard and the studio aren‚Äôt taking it seriously.

but according to forbes, it now seems that warner bros. has also fired amber heard from the dc extended universe to replace her with the mother of dragons. while no official confirmation has been released from warner bros. regarding clarke‚Äôs casting, the decision can work wonders as it will once again reunite clarke with jason momoa. in game of thrones, the pair shared the screen as a couple which led to the earlier speculations of clarke replacing heard as mera in the dceu.

from some recent rumors that amber heard has been fired from aquaman 2, this now doesn‚Äôt appear to be the case. according to insider daniel richtman, talk that emilia clarke, who‚Äôs been linked to the role of mera before, is set to replace heard, has no basis in truth. and although this news may not be taken as positively by some people as it will be by others, it seems that heard‚Äôs immediate career prospects and personal life are going to be shadowed by these sorts of stories for a while yet.

of course, in recent weeks, richtman has also reported that the actress is angry at warner bros. for bringing in another female lead, reducing her screen time in the aquaman sequel. however, she‚Äôs apparently set to get a pay rise for her part in the movie, too, so it‚Äôs hard to really know what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes on the film.

heard-depp controversy isn‚Äôt going away anytime soon, it‚Äôs hard not to see aquaman 2 receiving a lot of scrutiny as it gradually heads into production. the studio has continued to back the actress in the last year, though, and it seems that she‚Äôs still very much in contention for other major roles in hollywood, despite negative online campaigns.

and that's all for today's video. tell us your thoughts on the replacement of amber heard in aquaman 2. don't forget to like this video and if you have not subscribe to my channel yet please do so. see you within the next video.

the famous filed by johnny depp for a whopping 50 million against amber along with the case, which johnny was losing tremendously, is constantly making headlines with its new developments making their way onto the news from time to time. in complete honesty, the storyline of these events between the pair could quite easily be converted into a telenovela show provided a great director is ready to take up this venture. 

yes, we are talking about the alleged charity donation that amber heard was going to make with the 7 million she scored from the divorce settlement. amber had stated that she wasn‚Äôt comfortable keeping the money of her domestic abuser with her and chose to give it towards a better cause.

the trial of the highly destructive case was clearly not in favor of johnny according to both him as well as his barrister andrew caldecott qc. but with fresh evidence on the table, things may actually look brighter for johnny‚Äôs fate in the case. 

johnny‚Äôs team is currently trying to get back at amber using the information with regard to her not paying off money towards the charity which she claimed she would do. amber had publicly announced that she would be donating the 7 million towards organizations that actually needed help with funding. she claimed to have given out the money to two different social causes and organizations. the two organizations that she stated she allegedly donated to were american civil liberties union (aclu) and the children's hospital los angeles. she even stated that her donations to aclu were done keeping in mind the hardships she had to bear with regard to her being a victim of domestic violence and wanted similar victims to benefit from these funds. so according to our unbiased calculation, each organization should‚Äôve received 3.5 million us dollars each. 

but did that actually happen?
knowing the recent truth about amber coming out, it is easy enough to guess that this was a lie too. evidence to back this claim up came when mr. caldecott from the children's hospital los angeles communicated with johnny‚Äôs business advisor in 2019 claiming that no payments were made by amber heard towards the hospital. 

at the when the evidence was brought out, it was found out that amber had paid just a mere 100,000 dollars towards the children's hospital los angeles and 450,000 dollars to aclu. she also stated that she made an anonymous donation of a grand total of 500,000 dollars to aclu, but that could pretty much be another lie too. 

now, what did johnny‚Äôs team have to state?
of course, they weren‚Äôt surprised. his team stated that this was all part of the manipulation bandwagon that she has been blinding everyone with for the past few years. even though amber has stated that she would be giving out the donations over a course of time, many do not believe this statement of hers either. depp‚Äôs team also spoke up about how she chose to pull off a facade in front of the public to gain sympathy from whoever she could. not only did she do this, but also was involved in putting johnny down and bringing her standard up in the eyes of the public. i think it is safe enough to say that the words of a gold digger are quite hard to believe, especially if they claim it is for charity, mr caldeco, guess it was just bad timing for johnny depp, especially with the famous me too movement blowing up during that time. 

they first had helped put her story out through their newspaper claiming johnny to be a ‚Äùwife beater‚Äù. now, mr. adam wolanski, a representative of the ngn, has stated that even though this bit of evidence can prove amber to be a gold digger, it does not necessarily support the fact that she wasn‚Äôt going to pay what she promised, as she probably planned to do it over a course of time and not at once for her own reasons. 

a certain incident was questioned by depp‚Äôs time, that spoke volumes about how the jury wasn‚Äôt looking into the evidence as much as they should. on a trip to australia, amber claimed to have a life threat against her due to the fact that she was being held hostage for three days all due to johnny depp. the truth behind this incident actually happening wasn‚Äôt looked into and was blindly believed by the jury, bruises. amber heard aquaman 2 jason momoa clevver news informoverload

so we guess most of you guys know about the messy divorce case that took place between hollywood superstar johnny depp and the gorgeous amber heard. ever since the proceedings of the divorce began in 2016, when heard played the domestic victim card, depp‚Äôs name in the industry has been deteriorating. he lost major, long-time roles in popular franchises like pirates of the caribbean and fantastic beasts. 

amber heard on the other hand? well, her popularity soared, despite the fact that no one knew who amber heard was. many film stars from the industry have also claimed of not knowing her until her infamous divorce case was the talk of the town. 

do you guys want to know a certain bunch of deals she struck after her gruesome divorce?

following the shocking interview, in which oprah winfrey sat down with prince harry and meghan markle, it seems some of meghan‚Äôs family have since come forward with claims of their own. if you‚Äôve yet to see or hear about oprah‚Äôs interview, the pair didn‚Äôt hold back, and spoke on a handful of factors leading to their decision to officially depart from the royal family. these factors included at least one member raising concerns about how dark the skin tone would be of the couple‚Äôs first born. there was also the immense pressure from the british media, on top of the pressure they felt just by being associated with the family. all in all, it seems they decided it wasn‚Äôt something they wanted their family to be a part of. however, it seems those closest to meghan, her family, had issues with the interview, and have since come forward with claims of their own, in a sense dismissing a lot of what meghan had to say.

wgtc is a movie ""news"" website, which mostly spits out false lies/rumours. over the last few months, we have seen them rally with heard and go against anything positive that may include johnny depp.

now, this video is about the harry potter franchise (which depp was once involved with) and this shows the things they write are only for them to gain from. 

they have a large number of ""journalists"" who support heard, which is their choice to do so. however, when they start spinning false news and narratives, it can be harmful.

this video is like cliff's notes and there's lots i had to leave out to keep this under twenty minutes (such as the dog smuggling, allegations/evidence of amber cheating on johnny, the staged cell phone incident with rocky and io,  amber's mysterious disappearing bruises that many claim she faked, and of course her failure to pay the money she said she donated to charity). 

there's so much more to discuss, so i've uploaded a second video with additional analysis at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp_xhpk6okc 

i forgot to add the picture of amber doing her walk of shame outside court, so here it is. as i said, this ""bruise"" mysteriously disappeared in other photos around the same time, damaging her credibility: https://www.eonline.com/news/768562/amber-heard-leaves-court-visibly-bruised-after-judge-grants-johnny-depp-restraining-order

due to aquaman‚Äôs major success, soon after its release, the second sequel to the movie was announced to be premiered in the year 2022. unfortunately, with the me too movement targeting so many a-listers, one of the cast members was accused of being a part of this bandwagon. any guesses on who fell off the wagon and joined in amongst the list of abusers? yes, it was amber heard!

amber heard has been making headlines regularly for almost 2 years now, especially after her divorce from johnny depp. initially, people assumed her to be the poor victim in the chaotic scenario she had going on with johnny depp. at one point, we were pretty convinced that she was the victim after she posted her pictures of the scars that she had obtained due to being a victim of domestic violence. 
 
what were amber‚Äôs claims?

amber heard proved to be the biggest victim of the year, with her constant rants on social media as well as her claiming johnny depp to be an evil man with anger issues. she kept throwing out lies until one day depp was forced to sue her, hence causing the famous chaotic court case to make repeated headlines.

how did ambers claims backfire?
 
johnny depp was proven innocent to his ex-wife‚Äôs claims after a leaked conversation between the two was released, proving that in fact, it was johnny depp who was being victimized. this surely didn‚Äôt save the mess he was in but made the likes of big platforms such as disney apologize to him for believing the allegations.

how did this news worsen?

the me too movement was trending and each day a new celeb was being called out for inappropriate behaviour of misconduct with the co-workers, especially the female ones. due to this being embedded in the minds of all, depp was the most likely candidate to get abuser-bashed for his immoral actions.

due to her alleged accusations, johnny depp‚Äôs career was quite miserable. in fact, the production teams that loved working with his massive talent started to reject his role in the movies. and all this was due to the fault of amber and her bunch of lies. imagine not having jack sparrow in the next pirates of the caribbean sequel!

what‚Äôs the big question now?

what‚Äôs racing across everyone‚Äôs mind is what does amber heard‚Äôs co-star, jason momoa, have to say about this? 

as you may be aware, warner bros just like all other entertainment entities, have the contents of the contract that they sign with the actors, strictly specifying them to follow privacy protocols, leaving the actors with little to nothing left to say about what goes on with the production of their movie as well as any other activities that take place under the roof of the warner bros. 

jason momoa has been adhering to the protocol and has not stated anything about the scandal his co-star was involved in. it shows that he doesn‚Äôt care about this blow -up or change in the cast, or that he has been asked by warner bros. to keep this situation on the low.

but, was momoa and heard compatible in real life as much as they seemed on screen?

rumor has it that the momoa and heard were not as compatible as they seemed on the screen. with them being actors from two different worlds, it is sure to be quite a clash in the studios. but others state that they were actually good together since they were complete opposites and that opposites attract. even though they seem great together on the red carpet, always having fun, the truth behind this fact is still left unknown!

would momoa‚Äôs word and stance on this scenario change the fate of who plays the role of mera?

most probably, yes. without jason, there is no aquaman. in fact, the entire success behind aquaman was 90% due to jason momoa‚Äôs efforts in making the storyline as lively. without him, reaching this milestone would have been highly impossible. on a serious note, it‚Äôs highly possible that rather than risking their biggest asset, warner bros. would not sacrifice their king for the sake of amber!

johnny depp and amber heard were big names of the industry back when they met each other on the sets shooting for ‚Äúthe rum diary ‚Äú back in 2011. johnny depp, also lovingly known as the jack sparrow for his impeccable acting in pirates of the caribbean, was 47 and amber was 25 when they fell for each other. depp, being married to vanessa paradis, with whom he had two children, announced his separation from her in 2012. also heard was also known to split up with her partner tasya at the same time. rumors about a budding relationship between depp and amber were speculated around which were intensified after heard had posted an engagement ring on one of her social media accounts. 

in may 2016, amber heard filed for divorce from johnny depp. she alleged that depp used to physically abuse her during their relationship. she also quoted that during such an incident, depp had thrown his phone at her face, leaving severe bruises. he was also alleged to smash things all around the place in their apartment that night. there were negotiations and finally they reached a $7 million settlement as heard withdrew her domestic violence accusation. later, according to heard, she donated the money to charity as she wasn‚Äôt comfortable with it, holding the money of a domestic abuser. 

they simply said that throughout their relationships, depp has never been violent with them. depp claimed that heard was having an affair with elon musk also at the same time. depp has also alleged that heard hit him which she denied. heard, in response, said that she had received death warnings from depp several times. the trial continued in many hearings. depp was denied to appeal against the ruling two times in a row. during the evidence given at the application hearing, depp's team said that they had not received a fair trial and presented ""fresh evidence"" that alleged heard lied about donating her full $7 million divorce settlement to charity. depp's team andrew caldecott told the that heard's claim about the donation was a lie that ""tipped the scales against mr. depp from the very beginning,""

depp‚Äôs team claim that the false depictions of rampage which included red wine splashed over the place, a huge mess of broken glasses, and shabby walls of the penthouse are completely opposite to what the police quote. that night 4 lapd officers visited the couple‚Äôs royal penthouse when heard‚Äôs friends mistakenly dialed 911 twice within a span of two hours. the first officers who reported at the spot within 15 minutes of the assault were tyler hadden and melissa saenz. melissa saenz is a domestic violence expert. 

asked by depp's attorney, if she remembered spotting anything resembling the damage depicted in heard's photos during her inspection, melissa confidently replied: 'i did not.'hadden was of the same opinion as melissa regarding the incident.

despite one of heard‚Äôs friends claiming to have cleaned the place between the two police visits but he was quite sure that there was a big stain of the wine in the hallway. depp‚Äôs team says that it is impossible that two sets of cops can miss the large red wine stains and abides by his saying that heard has been lying throughout.
with heard and her partners having multiple times referred to this incident and tipping the judgment of the in their favor, this simply seems to be manipulating the with lies and false witnesses after seeing the clip. 

this controversy has dented depp‚Äôs image in the industry, he has already lost his role in the movie ‚Äòfantastic beasts 3‚Äù. he also has to pay a hefty price to the ones he is fighting against after the jury decided against him in . but surely this news is important in the context of the case. this can change the outcome of the case as heard can be easily accused of misleading the case and falsely accusing depp of abuse. this case is getting more and more intense with time. me too movement

in 2018, johnny depp appeared in five films. in 2019, he appeared in only one. now johnny is suing amber for libel and defamation as a result of the damage that her allegations have done on his career. join trender as we explore why amber heard is now facing jail time.",117.0,3063.0,,,,,,2910.0,8.0,0.0,28.0,amber heard is now facing jail time,,,,,,,,,,

analysts say that the actress might face as much as three years in jail for faking her injuries to get a restraining order against her husband. johnny depp sued the mera-actress for defamation over domestic abuse allegations, claiming his wife as an abuser. it is claimed that heard may actually have faked her injuries to make it look like depp was involved in domestic violence to get a restraining order against him.

https://youtu.be/hqffm_x2lps

that‚Äôs crazy, as the tables have turned and now amber heard is the one who‚Äôs criticized by
so many people. but why is she the subject of such a toxic response? johnny and amber
have both accused each other of abuse. first, people thought that johnny was the ‚Äòbad guy‚Äô
but now, fans think that amber is the one who is doing it for attention, enjoying the drama,
manipulating the truth, exaggerating reality.
moreover, people were absolutely furious after amber heard‚Äôs former assistant kate james
exposed amber heard for stealing her sexual assault story.
for so many women struggling from abuse, it was difficult to hear but, that's true that amber
really lied about the fact that johnny abused her. and the whole world was shocked after
kate james, amber heard‚Äôs former personal assistant, alleged that heard had appropriated
her story of being a ‚Äúsexual violence survivor,‚Äù giving evidence at london‚Äôs royal courts of
justice on the seventh day of johnny depp‚Äôs libel trial against the publisher of the sun
newspaper.
however, the fact that kate exposed amber is really good for johnny, as now he is suing
news group newspapers and journalist dan wootton for an article on the sun website that
described him as a ‚Äúwife beater.‚Äù depp denies that he was violent toward heard, to whom he
was married from 2015 to 2017.
kate gave evidence in support of depp, and said she had told heard that she was raped at
machete-point in brazil about 25 years ago. she said she was shocked to learn that in a
witness statement, heard misrepresented and exploited the incident.
‚Äúshe referred directly to a violent rape that occurred to me 26 years ago and she twisted it
into her own story and she used it for her own use,"" kate james said by video link from los
angeles. ‚Äúi am a sexual violence survivor and that‚Äôs very, very serious to take that stance if
you are not one,"" she added.
when kate she read amber heard‚Äôs submissions, she said, ‚Äúto my utter shock and dismay, i
discovered that ms heard had in fact stolen my sexual violence conversation with her and
twisted it into her own story to benefit herself. this of course caused me extreme distress
and outrage that she would dare to attempt to use the most harrowing experience of my life
as her own narrative.‚Äù
referring to amber heard‚Äôs drinking habits, james said in a witness statement: ‚Äúamber
would drink vast quantities of red wine each night.‚Äù plus, in evidence given remotely from
los angeles, kate james also said she had regularly received a barrage of drunken,
abusive and incoherent text messages from heard between 2am and 4am.
in her declaration, james outlines how she spent large amounts of time with heard during
her employment - sometimes up to seven days a week, often in intimate settings. that is
significant, she says, because many of heard's allegations of physical abuse date to that
time period - and she never saw any evidence of it. instead, she claims to have seen ample
evidence of heard's own abusive behavior, which was often directed at her.

‚Äúamber was regularly verbally and mentally abusive and would often scream at me... over
the smallest things,‚Äù she wrote. ‚Äúshe would fly into blind rages where no-one could reason
with her, and even if i was trying to offer an explanation, i didn‚Äôt think that she could hear me
as she was so angry.‚Äù
kate james claims the actress would often binge on wine and drugs - specifically magic
mushrooms and mdma - and text her abuse throughout the night.
‚Äúwhen i woke up in the morning, there would almost always be a barrage of incoherent
abuse sent to me from amber by text between around 2am and 4am. i discovered later that
she had gone ahead and deleted all evidence of abusive texts from that icloud account,‚Äù
she claimed. the abuse was so severe, that james said it left her emaciated from stress and
caused concern among her friends and family.
...

and now i want to know what you think about amber heard. do you think she really enjoys
the drama and does it for clout? let me know your opinion in the comments section down

about:
four years later the couple were back in court, but this time in london. however, this was not amber heard's case - she had not chosen to be here. this was a libel action depp had brought against a british newspaper, the sun. at the heart of the case was his assertion that the allegations of physical abuse were an ""elaborate hoax"". depp employed one of the best-known libel barristers in the country to try to prove the claims were untrue.
over the next three weeks, heard arrived at court each day and walked past her former husband's fans, who were convinced that it was their hero who was the victim and it was she who had assaulted him. in court her story, photos, memories and the accounts of her friends were all exposed to the world and said by depp's team and supporters to be part of a plot to falsely prove that he was, as the sun had claimed in april 2018, a ""wife beater"".

it was not just the fans and media who were watching carefully. lawyers were already wondering, if he won, what impact this would have on women coming forward with claims of domestic violence. outside, johnny depp would arrive each day to cheers. but his behaviour and lifestyle were also under the microscope - and a judge has now ruled that the sun's allegations were ""substantially true"".

s'il a d√©cid√© de l'assigner, c'est pour prouver qu'il n'a jamais √©t√© violent avec amber heard et que la com√©dienne a entretenu une relation avec elon musk lors de leur mariage. ainsi, les avocats de johnny depp demandent que le jeune papa transmette ""toutes les communications entre lui et mme heard concernant m. depp"", ainsi que ""toute all√©gation de violence physique ou domestique commise par m. depp ou mme heard"". elon musk n'a pas encore r√©agi, mais a plusieurs fois contredit le com√©dien.

over the past couple of years the media has been flooding with news regarding the situation with johnny depp and amber heard. the issue between the two is that there were so many who were trying to figure out who was the victim in the relationship since there were different stories from each party in the relationship. as the case moves along further what many have noticed is that the finger is starting to solely point to amber heard as more and more evidence gets brought forward. people all over the world are starting to believe that johnny depp was wrongfully accused of several different acts, none of which he actually performed. many are aware that this led him to not only lose several of his important acting roles, but also put him in a very tough place with the media.

the johnny depp and amber heard court drama made a major plot twist when johnny depp filed a defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife. he not only claimed that she lied in court, but also that she was wronged toward him. however, the actors will need to wait even longer to get an official court ruling. if the court rules in johnny depp‚Äôs favor, amber heard could be facing serious consequences.

the possibility of amber heard going to jail already has fans asking who would replace her in aquaman 2. and even if she doesn‚Äôt get sentenced to jail time, based on the information that johnny depp has already released to the public, many fans have petitioned for amber heard to be replaced in aquaman 2 regardless. rumors have even started swirling that emilia clarke would be her replacement. be sure to watch the whole video and see what lies amber heard has been hiding all these years! in addition, do us a favor and like the video and subscribe and turn on the notification bell. we‚Äôll see you in the next video!

in the video emilia clarke speaks out about her possibly taking over for amber heard as a replacement in aquaman 2!!!
during 2020 a lot of great comic book movies were delayed because of the world situation, but that is all about to change for 2021! aquaman 2 is a potential movie that we might be getting to see in 2021 or at least in 2022, but after all of the drama between amber heard and johnny depp, then amber heard has been removed as mera in aquaman 2, and the game of thrones idol emilia clarke might be the one to replace her!

why did the couple get a divorce?
with amber heard‚Äôs beauty and johnny‚Äôs amazing personality, talent, and success we were almost alluded to believe that this super couple may actually work. but if even the strongest couples like brangelina can break up, this is probably next to nothing in front of them. 

so as the cliche series of events of any regular hollywood love story goes, the couple were in love, dated for a while, and boom! married in a few years. but the year following came with quite a quick divorce leaving the couple and the showbiz world with nothing but pure messy drama!

and here we are, suckers for drama, trying to keep up with the latest gossip on what this couple is up to next.

what were the crazy events that took place after the divorce?
honestly, the details of the events that took place after the divorce took so many turns that even sherlock holmes would‚Äôve been confused, resulting in him taking quite a long time to unravel the truth. for starters, the divorce involved depp paying amber a whopping 7 million.

for those of you who do not know who mera is, mera is the female protagonist of the dc billion-dollar grossing movie aquaman which was such a huge success that warner bros. declared the news of there being a sequel almost immediately. 

but all this happened in 2018 when things for amber were all playing out in her favor. fast forward to 2020, the pandemic wasn‚Äôt the only concern for her as 2020 brought out so much evidence against her in the 50 million dollar filed by johnny depp that she was trapped, not knowing what step to take next. i think by now it is safe enough to say that this woman will stoop to any level to get things done her way. 

so back to her aquaman debut in 2018, due to the film being quite a hit, warner bros. didn‚Äôt want to delay in releasing the sequel which is said to be out in 2022. but the famous petitions against her along with her making constant headlines have left us to wonder if she actually still has a spot on the cast list. for the sake of justice, we truly hope not just warner bros, but the entire showbiz industry thinks twice before casting her.

has she been getting roles in the film industry considering the blow-up of the scandal?
unlike johnny being rejected for movies he has made his legacy with, amber has been scoring quite a few films. in fact, she has a mini-series on netflix currently running as well as her role in aquaman 2.

so yes as far as we know she will be coming back on the big screens next year, but her time on screen may be cut short so as to not infuriate the fans further. but hey, did you guys hear about the rumors of emilia clarke being a suitable replacement for amber on the cast?! 

what has amber got to say about her actions and this situation as a whole?
the woman has been seen laughing it off on various occasions. if she is not holding up a strong facade, she is busy coming to her defense with ever-ready tales of lies. 
a while back she was seen getting frustrated at how the public has been going against her, causing her to reach an infuriated state hence causing her to state that what is being said is not fair and that no one could take the role of mera from her. 

let us keep all this aside and head on to talking about jason momoa. how does he fit into all of this? aquaman is jason momoa! the hunk is known to have been the main reason why the first aquaman movie was such a big hit and warner bros. is counting on him to do them proud with its sequel too. in fact, the man is said to have brought the comics to life with his acting which truly made the movie gain tons of fans. amber heard aquaman 2 celebrity news clevver news amber heard fired

2]how amber heard destroyed her own career
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwubrffr8&ab_channel=bingewatch


the actress began her career in 2003 and saw her ratings improve during her married years. she got big films like magic mike xxl, danish girl, and adderall diaries. she was also cast on television and played a guest role in some shows.

amber heard was initially told by her friends and family that an acting career would mean that she would have to sacrifice a lot. in fact, amber was told not to come out as bisexual because people in the limelight often face backlash for not being straight. however, she held her ground, kept courage, and came out.
but, honestly speaking, not many people knew who amber heard was. many film stars from the industry have also claimed of not knowing her until her infamous divorce case was the talk of the town. 

like we said earlier, her marriage boosted her acting career, and landed her some pretty sweet deals. let‚Äôs look at some of the roles she landed. 

well, for starters she was hired by the warner bros to play the role of mera in aquaman which was such a big deal for her as she had been playing smaller roles till then. this was also accompanied by her being the spokesperson of loreal paris, the world-renowned cosmetics brand. 

alongside these major milestones she hit, she was also appointed as the ambassador for women‚Äôs rights at aclu. she also pledged half of her divorce settlement to the group. those were truly some major accomplishments for her after her not-so-great kickstart in hollywood!

initially, when news broke out about the divorce, and amber‚Äôs claims of domestic abuse, everyone was in favor of amber and stood by her side, showering their support. in reality, she made a fool out of the public and her peers by playing the role of the victim. it was just a matter of time before the tables had turned and the truth was finally out about how johnny wasn‚Äôt as bad as he was portrayed by her and in fact, he was the victim himself.

now, how exactly did amber‚Äôs career come crashing down?
the truth about her defaming johnny depp, along with various other titbits of information led to media companies thinking twice before hiring her. for starters, the messy divorce proceedings and unwarranted drama almost cost her one of her major roles as mera in the dc movie aquaman, whose decision is still pending. 
not only is this at stake but also placed her on the verge of losing the contract that she had with l‚Äôoreal paris. to make things worse, the promised donations that she had to make to the aclu body, were allegedly never received. 

a funny twist to all these events is that she was a part of the aclu community and was one who many times spoke against gender-related discrimination and crimes. now, that‚Äôs a total maneuver!

so, what exactly caused her career to come crashing down?
not going to lie, but all the virtual rotten tomatoes that are being thrown at her by the public after the truth about her actions was out, was completely her fault. amber heard had strategically planned all her moves carefully all along. 

she had the prime goal of ruining johnny‚Äôs life as well as career, probably for his money as he was once worth 400 million dollars which kept deteriorating till it touched 150 million dollars as of now and is still dwindling due to the massive amounts he has to pay towards the lawsuit. 

doesn‚Äôt seem fair that all the backlash has to be borne by him, right?",6.0,143.0,,,,,,137.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,amber heard - shocking truth on how she destroyed her own career,,,,,,,,,,

zach snyder has announced that amber heard is done with dc movies because of her controversy and lies about her ex husband johnny depp. allegedly she has faked most of the accusations against johnny, which has cost both of them a lot of both time, money and energy.

amber heard was not seen in the new trailer for ""justice league: the snyder cut"" and fans were hyper-happy about it. 

hbo max released the newest trailer for zack snyder's ""justice league"" on sunday march 14, 2020, and it received a lot of praises, with many saying it was better than what was released in 2017. however, many also noticed that heard's name wasn't in the credits and they didn't see her in the trailer, making some wonder if heard has been removed from the movie.

but fans got thunder-struck when they saw that amber heard is still part of zack snyder's ""justice league'' 4 hours cut. what a trick there snyder.

amber heard replaced by emilia clarke in aquaman 2!?

the volatile nature of showbiz has yet another juicy scandal to entertain you with. before we get to the details of this video let‚Äôs take a minute to take you back a few years down memory lane, when the chemistry between drogo and khaleesi was the only thing everyone was talking about. remember that from game of thrones and how we all were dying to see more of those two? well, there is a high chance of that happening again. just in another movie.

aquaman was the knight in shining armor to dc after justice league caused immense disappointment amongst the fans. in fact, it is the first movie from dc to hit a billion dollars in its first weekend itself at the box office. this had not happened in a long time, the last such success being the dark knight rises. 

there is a high chance that aquaman‚Äôs mera, who previously cast amber heard in its first movie, may no longer play mera in the second part. you may have a tingle in your 6th sense, assuming it having to do with her messy divorce case. 

how did her divorce case turn into a scandal?
 most end peacefully but some end up in quite a mess. the same happened in the case of johnny depp and amber heard. they officially were to divorce in 2016, but due to amber getting the divorce involved in a libel case, the divorce procedures carried on. yes, it is true she accused him of being a threat to her and accusing him of engaging in domestic violence while they were married. 

amber, who ruined depp‚Äôs career by throwing false allegations and ruin his name publicly, got played by karma and is sitting in the same wretched seat her ex-husband has been sitting in, dreadfully, for the past few years.
  
to come back to the present, the truth about amber and her abusive nature is all out. fans are mad at both warner bros and disney turning down depp when instead it should‚Äôve been amber who was turned down. while heard lavishly has been getting roles and parading herself everywhere around hollywood, depp was the one facing the consequences with a damaged career and broken spirits! 

the fans signed a petition to kick her off the cast list. and guess what? the petition has almost a whopping 2 million signatures defending depp!
the petition has been taken so seriously, the entire film industry was speaking about it. due to this fact, this news reached the ears of the warner bros. hopefully, they will take further action, serving justice rightly.

who is the secret replacement in case amber is to leave? and will she live up to the expectations of the role of mera?

so yes, rumor has it that this bad behavior of amber will cost her the role of mera, which she totally deserves. the verdict on whether amber will be cast or not has not yet been given by the warner bros, but we hope they do what‚Äôs best for them as well as for what‚Äôs right.


speculations have been going around that emilia clarke, an ex- co-actor of jason momoa, who plays the role of aquaman, is someone everyone has their eyes on. especially the fans. the fans seem very pleased with her replacement and have been pushing this idea on social media.

emilia clarke is not only a great actress but one who has a great personality in real life too. apart from that, the bond shared between momoa and clarke, both off and on-screen is marvelous. 

what do warner bros have to say about this?

letting her stay could do some major damage especially when we are in a time where everyone is fighting for their rights as well as for the rights of others. in this case, fans were outraged when this discrimination took place. discrimination against whom you may ask. but it‚Äôs pretty evident by now that we are talking about depp.

depp was not allowed to be a part of the next sequel of the pirates of the caribbean franchise due to this scandal which blew up. in fact, he was asked to step down from his role in fantastic beasts as well. amber truly ruined his career. it is only fair that justice is served cold to her too.

amber‚Äôs accusations came at the height of the #metoo movement, and the actress was hailed as a ‚Äúhero‚Äù for speaking up about the alleged violence she endured during her relationship with johnny.
but it‚Äôs 2021, and the narrative has completely changed. the fans are now convinced amber was the violent one in the relationships and that she tried to frame johnny by co-opting the #metoo movement.

 amber heard could be facing jail time! 
amber heard could be jailed for three years in domestic abuse case against johnny depp
amber heard could serve up to three years in prison in domestic violence and defamation case against ex-husband johnny depp.
the aquaman starlet can be jailed if found guilty for manipulating and faking evidence in the said lawsuit.
things started to get ugly between the former couple when amber accused johnny of hitting her, as a result of which, she sustained bruises and injuries allegedly.
amber, however, might be guilty of manipulating the evidence she submitted to court regarding this charge, after her stylist samantha mcmillen denied the claims, stating that she saw the actress on those days and see any bruises.
‚Äúthroughout the day of december 16, 2015, i could see clearly that amber heard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part of her bod,‚Äù samantha said.
if found responsible of tampering with the evidence, amber could be sentenced for three years.
according to us law firm wallin & klarich, the california penal code section 141 pc states that it is illegal to alter, modify, plant, place, conceal, manufacture or move any physical matter with the intention of causing someone to be charged with a crime.

emilia clarke speaks out on being amber heard's replacement in aquaman 2!!!

rumors have been on the loose of her replacing amber heard on the aquaman sequel after it hit a whopping 1.1 billion dollars over its first weekend. 

but why the change in cast members when the first movie was so successful? 

anyone would almost assume amber to be an angel fallen from heaven. but can the same be said about her personality? after all that went down between her and johnny depp, people are thinking twice about believing her to be the angel, or is she truly just an angel in disguise?

we have just one word to describe johnny depp and amber heard‚Äôs marriage. toxic. in fact, it was so toxic that johnny had his finger severed, resulting in him rushing to the emergency room to get his misplaced finger reattached to his hand. imagine that level of toxicity!

apart from all the drama going on, many are pretty glad they actually got a divorce and ended the trauma for not only both of them but also the fans that were shipping them to be goals prior to the terrible court scenes. 

jack sparrow has been missing for quite some time and we all by now know why. for those of you who aren't aware why to watch further ahead to find out the real reason behind depp‚Äôs absence from the film industry. 

depp is said to be a great person on and off-screen. this was quite believable to all until his ex-wife amber heard played the role of victim accusing him of being the unimaginable - a domestic abuser. this not only broke his spirits but sabotaged his career simultaneously.

the sad part is that depp lost his role in the upcoming the pirates of the caribbean movie, as well as his role as grindelwald in fantastic beasts due to this one blatant lie.

hell broke loose amongst his fans. they wanted justice. just like every single person on earth has a voice to be heard, the fans gathered up to declare one strong message to the film industry, especially warner bros. change.org was the platform they all targeted to make sure that depp deserved the justice to the time spent in guilt when he actually wasn‚Äôt.

alas! amber was finally cornered. news on her scandal blew up. she was on every piece of gossip and what was written about her wasn‚Äôt at all good. this infuriated her and she took to the media in a very immature way, laughing off the matter at every instance to bursting into fits of anger when people stated that warner bros would sue her. 

she clearly was delusional when she stated that absolutely no one could kick her off the aquaman 2 squad, when all she is, is a cast member and nothing else. 

but would warner bros. wish to lose millions in case they don‚Äôt switch their cast?

fans have apparently voiced their concerns on how they would boycott the movie by not giving it the hype they gave to the first part if amber heard was cast as mera. in fact, they claimed not to watch the movie at all and this is quite a worrisome shift of events at warner bros. but worry about.

emilia clarke as we mentioned earlier, is everyone‚Äôs holy grail on this subject. the chemistry the khaleesi and drogo had is unforgettable, leaving fans to wonder how that would play out if she was to play mera in aquaman 2. 

shooting for aquaman 2 is expected to start in the summer of 2021, but the cast is being quite quiet on the subject. the politics that are going on behind the screens yet are left unknown causing us to wonder what emilia has to say about this.

emilia has said nothing through words but has actually shown us some evidence that the mother of dragons may actually have already been asked to play the role. the best part to this being, she may have even said yes. how do we know that?

well, a few of her fans, or rather paparazzi, have claimed to have seen her parading around with red hair. some have even stated the red hair was accompanied by an attire that was green. 

i guess that's proof enough that something big is being hidden from us which may or may not be aquaman 2 related. 

jason momoa has clearly been hushed by warner bros. it‚Äôs either that or he personally doesn‚Äôt like to get into feuds with his co-actors and prefers to be a man of peace. but whatever may be the reason, from the looks of it, he isn't going to crack anytime soon. clevver news inform overload amber heard aquaman 2 amber heard fired

how amber heard destroyed her own career

amber heard‚Äôs lawyer exposes her for ruining johnny depp

https://youtu.be/pzr2_v4upgi

amber heard officially fired from aquaman 2 role! (reactions)

https://youtu.be/qbcexsvjbrm

amber heard was extremely successful after divorcing johnny depp: she got cast in the
biggest movie franchise of her career - dc's 'aquaman' - became the spokesperson of
cosmetics giant l'or√©al paris, as well as american civil liberties union (aclu) ambassador
for women's rights with a focus on gender-based violence.
so many people even claimed they have never heard about amber until this infamous
divorce: ‚Äúhad no idea who she was until that divorce. i didn‚Äôt even know that it was her who
played mara!‚Äù - one fan said.
however, the tables have turned and now amber heard is finding that her career as an a-list
hollywood actress might be over. she has reportedly been kicked from aquaman 2 and she
is about to lose the contract with l'oreal paris.
so what was the reason for all of these problematic events for amber heard? apparently,
her well-planned strategy to ruin johnny depp‚Äôs life has been shattered. and now no one
believes that amber is an innocent victim as johnny showed in a court undeniable evidence
of amber being an abuser (audio, text messages and so on).
heard lost the appeal to dismiss johnny depp‚Äôs $50 million defamation lawsuit and we
learned that the aquaman star could be facing up to 3 years of jail time if found guilty of
manipulating evidence against her then-husband. but even beyond the former couple‚Äôs
seemingly never-ending legal battle, heard has come under a lot of fire after evidence
presented to the court as part of the lawsuit revealed that she‚Äôs physically and emotionally
harassed depp while twisting the narrative in her favor and painting the pirates of the
caribbean actor as a domestic abuser.
in fact, the petition to remove her from aquaman 2 recently reached a whopping 400,000
signatures and is on its way to passing the half-million threshold. this is essentially the same
kind of backlash and blacklisting that depp had to endure a couple of years ago, so you can
see why fans of the legendary star are asking for justice with such fervency. and now,
according to a new report by cosmic book news, warner bros. has gone forward with firing
heard from aquaman 2 by buying out her contract.
also there was one more petition against amber heard. ‚Äúa liar and an abuser, a shame for
women,‚Äù begins one of two change.org campaigns to remove amber heard, 33, from her
role as global spokesperson for cosmetics brand l‚Äôor√©al.
and yet, she has claimed in her court declaration countering ex-husband's $50 million
defamation suit against her that her career took a serious hit and she received death threats
that forced her to constantly keep on changing her contact details.
here is what amber declared in her motion to dismiss johnny depp‚Äôs lawsuit filed in fairfax
county, virginia circuit court:
""following my highly-publicized separation from johnny, i read accounts in the media
referring to me as a victim of domestic violence. in response, many people called me a liar

(without ever hearing my story). i was dropped from a global fashion brand's upcoming
campaign. i lost a part of a movie in which i had already been cast. people i have never met
or spoken to threatened me with violence. i received so many death threats i had to change
my phone number on a near-weekly basis.‚Äù
isn‚Äôt it fair that her career might be over with johnny as it started with him?
as reported by meaww earlier, although heard's career in the entertainment industry began
in 2003 when she appeared in two music videos - kenny chesney's 'there goes my life'
and eisley's 'i wasn't prepared,"" and went onto star in an array of tv shows and movies, her
career really took off in 2015 ‚Äî the same year when she married depp ‚Äî when she had
prominent roles in four mainstream movies.


now i want to know your opinion. do you think amber heard‚Äôs career will be over soon as
she destroyed it on her own? let me know what you think in the comments section down

dying nadine scene (amber heard)
nadine scene (tosses herself)
dead scene from series: ""the stand"" (2021)

‚Ä¢ original title: ""the stand""
‚Ä¢ episode title (s01e08) ""episode 8""
‚Ä¢ adventure, drama, fantasy 
‚Ä¢ creators: josh boone, benjamin cavell
‚Ä¢ stars: whoopi goldberg, alexander skarsg√•rd, james marsden, amber heard 
‚Ä¢ imdb: 5,5/10


the stand episode 8 release date
‚Äòthe stand‚Äô episode 8 is scheduled to premiere on february 4, 2021, on cbs all access at 3 am et. the miniseries is slated to have a total of nine episodes.

spoilers ‚Äòthe stand‚Äô is also titled ‚Äòthe stand.‚Äô it is the penultimate episode of the limited series. if the show follows the stephen king book closely, then the upcoming episode will see glen executed by lloyd after he denies bending his knee to randall flagg. the episode may also see a dying nadine prophetically telling flagg that four men from boulder would be his end. in the book, a livid flagg tosses nadine from the penthouse balcony, thus killing her instantly. the next episode might also see the trashcan man return with the nuclear weapon that flagg wanted.

titled ‚Äúthe stand,‚Äù the stand season 1 episode 8 is soon going to be released. the post-apocalyptic fiction has been getting mixed reviews since its premiere. this show is based on a book penned down by stephen king. it went by the same name and was published back in 1978. the makers took very long to realize that the book is worth having a tv adaptation.

the stand s01e08: in a world mostly wiped out by the plague and embroiled in an elemental struggle between good and evil, the fate of mankind rests on the frail shoulders of the 108-year-old mother abagail and a handful of survivors. their worst nightmares are embodied in a man with a lethal smile and unspeakable powers: randall flagg, the dark man.

the hate story began on may 23, 2016, when heard filed for divorce from depp and obtained a short-lived restraining order against the oscar-nominated actor. she stated that depp had physically hurt her several times during their relationship and said it had been usually while he was under the influence of medicine or alcohol.
she described that when filing for divorce, an accident had taken place during which depp threw his phone at her, giving her a bruise on her face. however, a police spokesman told folks that an in-depth investigation into the domestic incident radio call found that no crime had taken place.
depp stayed silent on these accusations and announced through his representatives that heard was ""attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse.""

by doing so people found out he had been setting out hints revealing the truth about his past marriage and his ex-wife accusations. and it seems that after all this time, her accusations and her statements were never really lined up. watch this video to understand how amber‚Äôs team accidentally exposed her lies.

with a lot going on in the news between johnny depp and amber heard, their marriage, their divorce, and the abuse accusations, there is a lot more stirring up in the case! a new document has been circulated which states a nameless party, conjectured to be whitney henriquez, amber heard‚Äôs sister. 

it‚Äôs nothing but a subpoena!  rumour has it that amber heard has paid or let‚Äôs say bribed her sister, whitney henriques a hefty sum of 10,000 dollars to give false testimony, against johnny depp. yes, you have heard it right! 

how did the story of johnny depp and amber heard start? 

in short, their story can be covered in four words - courtship, divorce, and domestic abuse.

johnny depp and amber heard met on the sets of ‚Äòthe rum diary‚Äô back in 2009. soon after forming a warm camaraderie, the duo escalated their relationship and became lovers around 2012. both of them split up with their then-partners in the same year. 

but little did they know that this was soon about to make a turn for the worse. 

a fact to note here is that amber heard was arrested on the charge of physically assaulting her girlfriend van ree, which was later resolved, clearing the air. van ree defended her ex-girlfriend amber heard by stating that the police wrongly interpreted the actions and it was all just a misunderstanding. 

well, let‚Äôs just say something similar happened between johnny depp and amber heard, because just a year after their marriage, amber heard filed for divorce and accused johnny depp of physical assault. a temporary restraining order was also taken out against her husband.

what‚Äôs the status of the case so far? 

depp has denied amber‚Äôs claims of physical assault and has filed a defamation suit against amber heard for a whopping 50 million dollars. and now heard has finally filed her counterclaims, saying that she is the true victim here. 

let‚Äôs come back to the defamation case filed by depp against his ex-wife. the case revolves around a 2018 article amber heard wrote in the washington post, about being a survivor of domestic abuse.

despite johnny depp‚Äôs attempts to throw out the case against him, a judge has granted amber heard permission to file her 100 million dollar countersuit in response to the actor‚Äôs suit.  

johnny depp‚Äôs claims

amber heard was the abuser in the relationship with johnny depp, as per the claims of his former personal assistant. as a result of this incident, depp spent the entire time in the bathroom after his personal security intervened.  during the time the couple took a trip to australia, due to frictions between them, heard threw a bottle of vodka at depp and severed his finger. now, let‚Äôs delve into the testimony and the sum of $10,000 offered to whitney henriquez, amber heard‚Äôs sister. this document is a subpoena, it states that the person to whom it is addressed has to take a stand, they will be answerable to the court. that is followed by a number of requests for documentation and communications. the amount paid, clearly hints that something is fishy

if one has to pay for testimony from someone they are close to, precisely their own sister, then the accusations are feeble, lack real evidence, and reasoning. 

to explain what is mentioned in the document, here are two examples:

request number 1:  all documents or communications that refer, reflect, or relate to any physical or verbal (blank) in any form against anonymous and mr. depp.

request number 2: all communications you and (blank) that refer, reflect, or relate to any physical or verbal (blank) in any form against anonymous and mr. depp.
 
lastly, the documentation shows the amounts of monetary payments, gifts, or transfers in value of (blank) to you or for your benefit, with the connection of the defamation case, the divorce action, and or the sun case in the amount of $10,000 or more. an incident back from march 2015, gives a hint of evidence that amber would have perhaps bribed whitney to lie in the court against depp. henriquez justified the actions of heard when she had allegedly punched depp, which she defended by arguing that she threw her fist against him because she felt threatened by the possibility of depp pushing her down the stairs.  clevver news  amber heard aquaman 2  celebrity news johhny depp case amber heard case

victim is liberal progressives, women's rights, & united nations.
actions by bots can be programmed. 

see blacklivesmatter bot: 
https://thepetitionbot.com/
blm petition bot
tackling social justice through automation
140 petitions‚Äî-‚Äì‚Äî-2 minutes‚Äî-‚Äì‚Äî-70x manual speed
do not donate to change.org. doesn't go to people in petition. 

we're just showing you a simple traffic bot
it's not even programmed to then share on other sites or have
mixed types of bots responding to petition
(some sign, some share, some comment, etc)

if people really want to stop hate petitions, they will have to expose the industry for what it is
they will continue to make money off the most bots or the most hate

unless people expose it & tech workers say to stop it.

they make money off these hate petitions
netzdg or german law is against hate petitions

bots do not need an api to work.
rotating proxies works and solving captcha.
but this has no captcha
stopping with captcha reduces the time it can sign
but ai engines exist to solve captcha too
it still takes longer
not 20,000 a day as easily
different vpss with different ips
again, you can use multiple devices

""so even if you still use your bots, signatures will not count.""
lol? actually they do... if using a different ip and no symbols. 
google accounts don't require confirmation, especially when code is written to hide detection.

""thank you for contacting the change.org help center.
this sounds like an important issue, this kind of problem can be a bit worrying. 
however, thank you for letting me know about this issue. 
i am pleased to help you with this matter. 
the signature from bots on the petition will be discounted, 
and any other signature that does not meet the requirements. 
the reasons why a signature might not be counted are as following: 
if someone hasn't confirmed their email address after signing
if more than one person tried to sign from the same device or the same ip address.
their email addresses contain generic words 
(generic words or symbols in front of the @, such as admin, info, mail, +, -, etc).""
not signing with proxies because don't want it to.

what is the ratio for them to remove or add a silly recaptcha v2? 
it's signed thousands and multiple times since 5th, now it's 12th.

how many threats?
there were graphic images in a now closed reddit hate group.
one shot supporters of amber heard and it showed blood in the cartoon.
another video used the overloader botnet beginning in december, when the synthetic signatures on this petition skyrocketed, on a youtube video with 400k dislikes by social bots. https://youtu.be/uretrfma-io

adam waldman met with rudy guiliani not long before guiliani with others incited people to do the attack on washington dc jan 6. waldman is the lawyer posting disinformation in this targeting campaign against amber heard.
she said she was strangled and was threatened with being killed many times. 
no matter what you say to change, they do nothing.

thegeekbuzz's article was even posted about on the petition: https://www.thegeekbuzz.com/the-basement/video-reveals-bots-signing-anti-amber-heard-petition/

""strategic information operations (e.g. disinformation, political propaganda, and other forms of online manipulation) are a critical concern for democratic societies‚Äîas they destabilize the ‚Äúcommon ground‚Äù that we need to stand upon to govern ourselves. in this talk, i argue that defending against strategic information operations will require a more nuanced understanding of the problem. in particular, we will need to move beyond focusing on ‚Äúbots‚Äù and ‚Äútrolls‚Äù to looking at the collaborative nature of disinformation campaigns that target, infiltrate, shape, and leverage online communities. drawing from three distinct case studies, i describe how orchestrated campaigns can become deeply entangled within ‚Äúorganic‚Äù online crowds ‚Äîdistinguishing between orchestrated, explicitly-coordinated information operations and the emergent, organic behaviors of an online crowd.

https://youtu.be/n2q-kn4giwg

amber heard has been the center of attention of many controversies since her nasty divorce with the rum diary co-star and the popular hollywood celebrity johnny depp! the actress who has been a part of the warner bros and dc universe aquaman, the spokesperson of cosmetics brand l‚Äôoreal paris, as well as american civil liberties union (aclu) ambassador for women's rights has been getting negative responses and strong hate and it seems that she might have ruined her own career! 
in fact, if sources are to be believed the actress may not appear in the second installment of dc‚Äôs aquaman that will be released in 2022! and according to multiple websites the actress has been replaced by games of thrones star emilia clarke!!! in today‚Äôs video i will reveal how amber heard destroyed her own hollywood career in her attempts to defame johnny depp! but before jumping in the video you can help our channel grow by smashing those like, subscribe and bell notification buttons. a little action from you can help grow our channel tremendously!
and make sure to stick with us till the end of this video!

amber heard‚Äôs career started in 2003 when she first appeared in two music videos kenny chesney's 'there goes my life' and eisley's 'i wasn't prepared,"" and went onto star in an array of tv shows and movies, her career really took off in 2015 the same year when she married depp and when she had prominent roles in four mainstream movies. 
she played the lead in the comedy-drama 'magic mike xxl,' which like its predecessor, 'magic mike' (2012), was a huge box office success. heard also starred in the critically acclaimed historical drama 'the danish girl' and the independent crime thriller 'the adderall diaries.' she also appeared in the television film 'one more time.'
although she appeared in different television shows and a few movies but she was not in any way equivalent to johnny depp in fame or standing in hollywood. after she married depp her position in hollywood solidified and she started getting more recognition. after her divorce from depp she landed the biggest role of her career in the form of warner bros aquaman in which she played the character of female lead mera alongside justin momoa. 'aquaman' became the fifth most profitable release of 2018, and the most profitable dceu installment till that point.
at that time she also got selected as the brand ambassador of loreal paris and became the representative of women rights in aclu! she got these opportunities after she blamed depp with domestic violence accusations and pretended to be a victim. this earned her a lot of support and she became successful.  l'oreal announced in 2017 that heard will be the new global spokesperson, calling her ""fearless, witty and smart"" and a woman who defied definition and rejected convention. 
and yet, she has claimed in her court declaration countering ex-husband's $50 million defamation suit against her that her career took a serious hit and she received death threats that forced her to constantly keep on changing her contact details.
""following my highly-publicized separation from johnny, i read accounts in the media referring to me as a victim of domestic violence. in response, many people called me a liar (without ever hearing my story). i was dropped from a global fashion brand's upcoming campaign. i lost a part of a movie in which i had already been cast. people i have never met or spoken to threatened me with violence. i received so many death threats i had to change my phone number on a near-weekly basis,"" she declared in her motion to dismiss the 'pirates of the caribbean' actor's lawsuit filed in fairfax county, virginia circuit court.

but things started changing when new evidences came to light! initially most of the people were supporting amber in her fight against depp but when audio and video tapes of amber heard threatening depp were released many people were shocked and furious at heard!
ever since the verdict of the libel case was announced by the uk court, millions of johnny depp fans are criticizing  the ""aquaman"" actress. his fans recently started circulating a video featuring amber heard as a proof that although she has won the legal battle but people still hate the ""aquaman"" actress. the video is an interview of the actress posted on youtube channel ""access"" with more than one million followers.
the video has received only 16,000 likes while it has been disliked by more than 203,000 people. posted on december 15, the youtube video was watched by over a million people within 10 days.

it is already known that johnny depp was in fact fired from his role in the pirates of the caribbean series, as captain jack sparrow. fans of the series and more importantly, of johnny depp, were absolutely infuriated to see such a decision be made as many did not agree with disney's big decision, at all. yes, everything that has taken place between johnny depp and amber heard has drawn some insane amount of attention their way, however many believed it was just unfair for disney to go ahead with this decision. since, several sources have come out to say that depp was being reconsidered to be rehired as captain jack sparrow, however when the news first broke, everyone thought it would only be fair that disney came forward to apologize, so it just may seem that walt disney studios has finally stepped forward to make this apology. let us break it down for you but first be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel!

amber heard on the stand in johnny depp's libel case

https://youtu.be/it2kiyt7-rk

amber heard and johnny depp's divorce has been a surprise to the public, and now it's
been a several years of legal battle with no end in sight. it is no secret that johnny depp and
amber heard have been in a divorce case involving domestic abuse. at one point, amber
claimed that johnny was abusive and he didn't do much to fight back. later, as the
proceedings began, johnny made statements that amber was the abuser. we‚Äôre still seeing
the fallout of johnny depp‚Äòs catastrophic defeat in the british high court last year. his libel
case brought against the sun newspaper was intended to refute accusations that he was a
drug-addled domestic abuser and expose ex-wife amber heard as a fantasist. but it
backfired spectacularly, as not only was depp‚Äôs dirty laundry aired in public, but the judge
found heard‚Äôs testimony convincing and ruled that it isn‚Äôt libellous to describe him as a
‚Äúwife-beater.‚Äù
consequences came fast. he was almost immediately booted off fantastic beasts 3, has
reportedly lost several high-profile upcoming roles, and insiders say he‚Äôs currently blacklisted
in hollywood. but the most painful blow may come from disney, as the studio is apparently
planning to move forward on a pirates of the caribbean movie without captain jack sparrow
(but there‚Äôs also an information that disney allegedly rehired johnny depp but no one knows
for sure). but according to the latest information, amber heard was exposed by her lawyer
and the body language analyst announced that amber heard was not honest by accusing
johnny depp! and it seems like things are going so great for amber as well! recently she
was replaced by emilia clarke for the role of mera in aquaman 2, amber is now abandoned
by her own legal team. which means something really serious happened as so many people
changed their minds and now they are on johnny depp's side. actually, you may remember
that amber heard's former personal assistant claimed that she told the actress about a
violent se**al as**ult she had endured, only for heard to ‚Äútwist"" the story for her own use.
kate james gave dramatic testimony at johnny depp's libel trial against a british tabloid
newspaper that accused the actor of abusing ex-wife heard during their relationship. believe
it or not - it is up to you, but here is something else you need to know about amber heard.
anyways, the tables are turned now and many celebrities and fans support johnny depp,
and they believe him! moreover, now they are accusing amber of orchestrating a hoax to
ruin johnny depp‚Äôs career. and what is more, so many professionals from all walks of life
have come forward to prove that amber is lying. and someone who showed the whole world
that amber was not honest testifying in court against johnny was body language analyst
logan portenier from the popular youtube channel ‚Äòobserve‚Äô. according to logan
portenier, amber heard‚Äôs behaviour and facial expressions in her infamous 2016 court
deposition were strange and it was the reason why logan decided to make a deep analysis
of amber‚Äôs body language.
amber heard can be seen in a recording smirking and rolling her eyes while listening to a
recording of herself. in this video, the aquaman star can be seen rolling her eyes and eating
what seem to be cookies. she looks totally disinterested by what‚Äôs going on in the recording.
first, fans thought she was behaving that way because she was stressed out and scared.
but body language expert is convinced that the real reason why amber heard looks and
sounds like she is lying is because she actually is!

in the recording heard is listening to with the lawyers, depp can be heard claiming that
heard hit him with a bathroom door and then punched him in the jaw. she denies having
slammed the door in his face deliberately and then apologises for having hit depp in the face
on purpose. she can be heard pleading: ‚Äúi just reacted and i‚Äôm sorry. it‚Äôs below me.‚Äù but why
does she still act like she doesn‚Äôt care? at least right now, during the deposition.

johnny depp is accusing ex-wife amber heard of pocketing the massive $7m settlement from their divorce and repeatedly lying about giving it all to charity. heard, declared that she didn't want depp's money after their explosive 2016 breakup and vowed instead to split the payment between two charities.
in today‚Äôs video are going to share is johnny depp lied about amber heard not donating her $7m divorce settlement? 

hollywood star johnny depp defendant his ex amber detected of lying as she took a jaw-dropping $7million from their divorce settlement for herself despite promising to separate the cash between 2 charities. according to dailymail, the 34-year-old aforesaid that she didn't wish the cash from the 2016 divorce and instead vowed to provide it away. ""i remained financially freelance from him [depp] the complete time we tend to were along and therefore the entire quantity of my divorce settlement was given to charity,‚Äù she aforesaid in a very witness statement early in 2020.

however, depp‚Äôs lawyers believe that the goodwill gesture is nothing however a ‚Äòsham‚Äô because the legal team has pursued the children‚Äôs hospital la and therefore the yankee civil liberties union over whether or not they received the secure total. while the aclu has been silent, documents from the children‚Äôs hospital recommend that they need to be received solely $100,000.

in fact, the heads of the la children‚Äôs facility were involved in the purpose wherever they wrote to the aquaman star in june 2019 asking if she meant on fulfilling her promise. depp had sued the sun's publisher news cluster newspapers (ngn) and therefore the author of the article over claims he was violent to ex-wife amber detected throughout their volatile biennial wedding.

during the libel case hearing, decide saint andrew nichol noted heard's kind gesture and aforesaid that it absolutely was off from what a ""gold-digger"" would do. ""her donation of the $7 million to charity is hardly the act one would expect of a gold-digger,"" they decide aforesaid. depp's legal team can take the judge's remarks as a way to attractiveness the london find, that went against the actor, deed his name and career in tatters. but the actor's lawyers believe the selfless gesture was a 'sham' and have spent the past year chasing the children's hospital la and yankee civil liberties union to seek out out what proportion they really received from the role player.

the aclu has up to now refused to collaborate with multiple subpoenas however documents made by the hospital and seen solely by dailymail.com recommend it solely received $100,000 ‚Äì method wanting the secure $3.5m 'gift'.

in fact, bosses at the illustrious la children facility, which cares for sick children despite insurance or their ability to pay, became thus involved they wrote to detected in june 2019 to raise 'if the pledge won't be consummated.' depp's lawyers believe the correspondence is that the 'smoking gun' that proves detected was lying once she boasted concerning the giveaway, not solely in media interviews however in recent proof she gave to a london court.

the pirates of the caribbean star lost a bruising defamation case last year against the uk's sun newspaper once a british tribunal decides in agreement the publication's depiction of him as a 'wife beater' was 'substantially true' supported blood-curdling accounts of their various bust-ups. giving proof in a very witness statement dated february twenty-six, 2020, detected stated: 'i remained financially freelance from depp the complete time we tend to were along and therefore the entire quantity of my divorce settlement was given to charity.' judge saint andrew nichol cited the gesture whereas deciding the case within the sun's favor, writing: 'her donation of the $7 million to charity is hardly the act one would expect of a gold-digger.'

according to the source, depp's team can seize upon the judge's remarks in their efforts to attractiveness the london finding that left depp's name and career in tatters. the troubled actor, 57, is additionally tilling on with a separate $50 defamation suit filed in fairfax county, virginia, that accuses detected of making a 'hoax' account of being a force survivor for a 2018 news story.........

cancel culture enthusiasts thought that they might have been able to cross another name off the hit list over the weekend, when countless rumors began circulating that amber heard had been fired from aquaman 2 due to a breach of contract. those who recently celebrated disney and lucasfilm booting gina carano out of the star wars universe might not want to start popping those champagne corks just yet, though.

while james wan‚Äôs aquaman is the highest-grossing dc comics adaptation ever made and expectations are through the roof for the sequel to what was an entertainingly loud and endearingly dumb blockbuster, almost all of the talk surrounding the project has revolved around heard in some fashion, and it‚Äôs wearing pretty thin at this stage.

per boundingintocomics - a new set of documents presented by johnny depp and his legal team allege that amber heard lied about donating the entirety of her $7 million divorce settlement to charity, choosing to pocket most of the money instead. according to documents obtained by the daily mail, heard has only verifiably donated just $100,000 to the children‚Äôs hospital los angeles, one of two charitable organizations, alongside the american civil liberties union, that the aquaman star had vowed to donate her settlement to.

aquaman 2 2022 

in 2018, james wan‚Äôs aquaman became a remarkably surprising smash hit. nobody really knew what to expect from it for multiple reasons, given that it was following the disappointing release of justice league; centered on a character who had never had his own live-action solo movie. naturally, the excitement that the project generated immediately led warner bros. to solidify a future for the franchise, and within a few weeks of aquaman‚Äôs release we learned about their plans to develop an aquaman 2.

it‚Äôs typical for hollywood studios to try and produce sequels as quickly as they possibly can. after all, they don‚Äôt want to let the heat of a burgeoning franchise die down, and the more time that passes means there‚Äôs more opportunities for audiences to be distracted by other big properties. that being said, aquaman 2 is taking an extra minute to find its way to theaters, as warner bros. has announced that the blockbuster follow-up is currently scheduled to be released on december 22, 2022.

so, why is aquaman 2 coming out about four years after its predecessor? for starters, producer peter safran has noted that the filmmakers behind the movie don‚Äôt feel the need to rush the project, believing that giving the sequel the most development time possible will ultimately be beneficial for the final product. but that‚Äôs not the only reason. not only is the film going to need some legitimate time to actually get made from a logistics standpoint (it‚Äôs not super easy creating those underwater environments), but there are also many other dc extended universe titles in the works that the studio is developing between now and december 2022.

the drama between amber heard and johnny depp has had a lot of consequences for themselves, the people close to them, their careers but also for the movies that they are a part of! 
having a lead role involved in so serious issues is not something most companies want and therefore both amber heard and johnny depp have lost multiple roles because of this. but this has also hurt the movies themselves and the new upcoming aquaman movie ""the trench"" has most likely been cancelled because that amber heard couldn't be a part of it.

when the cut-up/edited 46 minute version leaked in january by depp‚Äôs team, it was made to portray a certain narrative and was used as propaganda. it was leaked 6 months before the trial began and used to lead people and potential jurors to believe that it was somehow an official piece of evidence, which it was not. it was incomplete.

actress amber heard sued her ex-husband johnny depp claiming he had verbally and physically abused her. depp has since made an effort to fight back, delivering her a defamation lawsuit after evidence of his innocence emerged in the form of a leaked recording from 2015, and a statement from heard‚Äôs hairstylist. but in a surprise twist, heard could be facing not just millions of dollars in this case, but also three years in jail.

this week, american actor johnny depp lost a libel suit he filed in london, suing the newspaper the sun for running an article that called him a ""wife beater,"" a reference to his relationship with ex-wife amber heard. it was an ugly case, dragging both actors' private lives into the spotlight. and it was a complicated case; each accused the other of abuse. but there was a clear winner, other than the tabloid paper: domestic violence victims.

the two debate the degree to which heard injured depp. at one point, heard tells depp she was hitting him: ""babe, you're not punched. i don't know what the motion of my actual hand was, but you're fine. i did not hurt you, i did not punch you, i was hitting you.""

but depp went a step further in may 2019, saying that ""while mixing prescription amphetamines and non-prescription drugs with alcohol,"" heard ""hit, punched and kicked me. she also repeatedly and frequently threw objects into my body and head, including heavy bottles, soda cans, burning candles, television remote controls and paint thinner cans, which severely injured me.""

#8: the divorce in 2016
the reasons she provided for her taking this decision involved her accusing depp of being an abuser, which was in fact quite shocking to his fans as well as the people who worked with depp, as this side of johnny was never witnessed by them.  initially, everyone was siding with amber, but eventually, the truth about heards violent nature came out. at the time of the divorce between the two celebs, depp was hushed and his word meant nothing as opposed to ambers. when amber provided the court with such reasons, depp denied these accusations and even stated that all this was being done by amber in her best interests, and not his. 

#7: the lawsuit in 2019
the messes the two of them were drowning in were further worsened by the onset of a lawsuit. and no, this time it wasn‚Äôt filed by amber, but in fact against her! amber heard expressed her feelings about johnny depp, using explicit content in an article published by the washington post, injuring depp‚Äôs reputation, which led to the beginning of the 50 million dollar suit against amber heard. 

#6: leaks of audio 2015
the audio leaks seemed to be the turning point for depp‚Äôs ill fate as this was one of the most solid forms of proof that helped enable him to be proved as the innocent in the messy trial.what did the leaked audio messages contain? the conversations between the two were as toxic as their marriage. it involved a lot of content that went along the lines of them being involved in domestic violence, her being the main abuser. 

#5: severed fingertip
if amber truly was the one to have faced being physically harmed why was depp‚Äôs finger left severed? according to various sources, including johnny depp himself, amber heard injured depp‚Äôs finger due to a heated argument that broke out between the two of them, resulting in him having to rush to the emergency room to get it fixed. in an interview, she claims he was the one who would constantly hurl things at her, when in fact later on it was proved it was just quite the opposite that was happening behind closed doors. 

#4: depp's bruised face 2020 & amber's fake bruises
to what extent this woman went to prove her innocence is quite disgusting we must say. at one point, amber had exposed her scarring and bruising on social media to damage depp. on investigating further into amber‚Äôs bruises, they seemed to be fake as the next day she made an appearance with no trace of even a single scratch on her. 

#3: premiere of alice through the looking glass
depp did a fabulous job in the movie alice through the looking glass. his fans were quite enlightened with his presence on the day of its premiere, but the same cannot be said about johnny depp! unfortunately, we all assumed his speech to include his dark humor which he constantly brings out from time to time but indeed many believe it to be a cry for help. he mentioned being in pain, being tired, and wanting to go home.


#2: career 2016 onwards
it is quite a well-known fact that once someone is surrounded by constant negativity, this not only takes a toll on their mental health but also starts affecting their professional life too. depp met amber on the sets of the rum diary, and both were happily married then. depp fell into amber‚Äôs trap, both ending their marriages and marrying each other a few years later. depp was quite a huge hit in hollywood. everyone wanted to hire him. the array of films he was getting by the year was massive and all he was doing at every award function was hoarding awards. it is quite evident that following 2016, things for him took a turn downhill professionally. 

#1: mother
depp‚Äôs mother was quite well known for her difficult nature. apparently, it was said johnny was the only person who could tolerate her cruel nature. it was till her very end that he stood by her side and tended to all of her needs. if depp could respect such a woman till her last breath, why would he ever harm someone who he claimed to have loved? there is no answer to that question by anyone but stands as a self-explanatory form of evidence to prove depp was not the kind of man to hurt any woman, especially amber. clevver news amber heard aquaman 2 celebrity news johhny depp case amber heard audio emilia clarke aquaman 2 informoverload

of course, in recent weeks, richtman has also reported that the actress is angry at warner bros. for bringing in another female lead, reducing her screen time in the aquaman sequel. however, she‚Äôs apparently set to get a pay rise for her part in the movie, too, so it‚Äôs hard to really know what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes on the film. meanwhile, campaigns to boycott it rumble on in the background, with the actress‚Äô legal battles with ex-husband johnny depp also set to resume this year.

mera will next be seen as a supporting figure in zack snyder‚Äôs justice league cut, and there‚Äôs even been talk that she could be upgraded to a more prominent presence in the league following the events of that picture. furthermore, heard can currently be found in the new version of the stand on cbs all access, wherein she appears as nadine cross, one of the more villainous figures on the show.

given how the heard-depp controversy isn‚Äôt going away anytime soon, it‚Äôs hard not to see aquaman 2 receiving a lot of scrutiny as it gradually heads into production. the studio have continued to back the actress in the last year, though, and it seems that she‚Äôs still very much in contention for other major roles in hollywood, despite negative online campaigns. for now, then, we can probably rule out a mera recasting.",2.0,40.0,,,,,,38.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,amber heard reportedly fired from another movie role latest update,,,,,,,,,,

our story
compassion with a heart
amber dawn shopay established global angel in 2018 in order to fulfill her desire to give back. she was inspired while on a trip to mexico with her father, after meeting a group of young kids playing soccer in a dirt field. they told her their greatest wish was to have grass on which to play.
 
amber couldn‚Äôt get the kids out of her mind and this set into motion a series of ideas about how to raise both money and awareness, on a local and global level.  it was actually quite simple - every area of the world has a need‚Ä¶and produces a product. what if one could benefit the other?
 
the happy result is global angel, a platform designed to offer high-quality goods that give back to the world, in just the way you choose. you pick the product; you pick the cause, because we‚Äôre more than just an online shopping destination. we‚Äôre a far-reaching, communal effort of compassion.

how it works
show us your heart
the hardships of our world can be pretty overwhelming leaving many people, places, creatures and causes in desperate need of an angel - it‚Äôs often confusing knowing where to begin.
 
global angel has streamlined the giving process by creating a platform allowing you to choose how you want to give back. we‚Äôve assembled a thoughtfully curated and ever-growing list of charities from around the world, many of which you may recognize and some that you might be interested in learning more about.

since the issue started it has been nothing, but full of drama and everyday the drama only seems to continue more and more. many are beyond excited to see that amber heard is truly being exposed for all of the lies she has been telling, but that is not all that has been brought to light when it comes to the situation with johnny depp. this case just goes to show that some will do anything for money and that really says something about amber heard's character. johnny depp was accused first of many things from amber heard as she went and shared with the washington post, but thankfully the judges in court have asked for more than just word of mouth. but allow us to break down everything else that has happened up until this point, but first be sure to like the video and as always subscribe to the channel!

the case between amber heard and johnny depp is one that people are following all over the world. the anticipation builds day by day while fans of the actors wait for the official court hearing. amber heard is starting to create a pretty bad name for herself, but now might be the time for an offical apology to johnny depp. a lot of other celebrities have been dragged into this mess - one is the tesla billionaire, elon musk (for some interesting reasons). and it does not seem like elon musk is quite done in this case, as depp is not done dealing with him.

""the overloader, the trendsetter, and the auto troll:

the overloader: this is a bot that literally floods an online conversation with its comments. it posts the same statements over and over again, causing other posts to get pushed out of sight. the overloader is only really effective if it works with other bots. 
when a botnet overloads a post with likes and comments, human users quickly lose control of the discussion. this makes it then impossible to exchange content this way.

the trendsetter: trendsetters also work best in teams: if a large number of social bots seize a hashtag together, they can easily spread posts relating to the topic of the hashtag. if the topic ends up trending on twitter or facebook, it might be picked up by the press. 

this way, the trendsetter bot distorts the actual relevance of the chosen topic area: they ensure that marginal phenomena act like groundbreaking trends, or small groups like large social movements.

the auto troll: it tries to distract users who express themselves on a certain topic and tries to involve them in a conversation. it usually does this with contradictory statements, which causes the user to retaliate. 

this distracts the user from the original conversation, and the new conversation becomes polemic and heated. with this method, bots can easily prevent users from exchanging content.""

when amber heard admitted that she was a victim of abuse from her marriage with her ex-husband actor johnny depp his career took a u-turn from success and fame. even though there was no evidence, the media chose to believe heard, and the most prominent film studios followed suit. these accusations resulted in johnny depp losing some of his most notable roles. you wouldn‚Äôt think how hollywood people are now treating the two of their most incredible artists!
the accusations first rose in 2016, when the #metoo and #believeallwomen movements were fresh on the hollywood press and film producers' minds. when amber heard came forth with a bruise and accused her, then, husband johnny depp of physically abusing her, the hollywood press and film industry took her side without questioning it.

over the past 4 years, zack snyder has gone through a lot of turmoil. after fans pleaded and petitioned worldwide to get the snyder cut of justice league, hbo max did it. they funded him and its ready to go.

warner bros has tried to sabotage zack snyder in the media and online through ""scoopers"" since he left justice league and supported the fans. 

now, what better way to get him more heat and hate, than to say ""he supports heard and told us we should keep her"". lets look into it.

last sunday, oprah interviewed meghan markle and prince harry about their experience stepping back from the royal family. and a lot of the interview was about the pain meghan has suffered at the hands of the british press. they are truly evil to her. that whole country talks about meghan like she stole their man, which, uhh, we guess she did. now, we look at meghan markle, and we see a nice lady in well-tailored clothes. but when the press writes about that same woman, all of a sudden, she‚Äôs ‚Äúdifficult,‚Äù ‚Äúnot appropriate,‚Äù ‚Äúunsuitable as a wife,‚Äù and favorite, ‚Äúuppity.‚Äù wonder why they chose that word‚Ä¶

show synopsis: amber showcases her signature smart-and-silly take on the news of the week, responding to it all with a charming, late-night mix of seriousness, nonsense, and evening gowns.

though she notes that positivity does not come easily, especially as a black actress, featherson's positivity is infectious and is felt in every interaction with her. she attributes her confident outlook on life due to divine alignment with her purpose: changing the world through her artistry and serving as a resource for women of color.

after dear white people debuted in 2017, variety described featherson as ""pitch-perfect,"" and tv guide said the actress ""is the comic force of the show."" in volumes 2 and 3, featherson continued to steal scenes and reviews. with her stunning cover of erykah badu's classic, ""tyrone,"" she is also the only cast member featured on the soundtrack.

recognizing a lack of mirrors for girls of color, ashley co-created the groundbreaking web series hello cupid alongside emmy-winner lena waithe. vulture selected hello cupid as one of the best web series of 2014 and the boston globe went further, declaring the series, and ashley, deserving of emmys.

in 2019, featherson again stood out and was hailed for her starring role in the macro produced series, leimert park, at sundance. she also starred in amber tamblyn's directorial debut, paint it black, the 2016 abc pilot, drew, and guest-starred in fox's glee.

featherson received her bfa in musical theater from howard university, and she currently resides in los angeles, ca.

........................................................................................

the marriage of amber heard and johnny depp not only ended in divorce but has led to a nasty legal battle after heard had accused depp of being violent and abusive. on the other hand, depp has come out with his own allegations and a tape has surfaced to reveal that heard had assaulted depp. as per reports, heard could easily face up to three years in prison if she is found guilty of manipulating or faking evidence against her former husband. a case in point would be the one incident in which heard had described how depp had given her two black eyes while the two were arguing.

amber heard went from being called a hero of the feminist movement to the most hated woman in showbiz.
after she first accused her former husband johnny depp of being physically aggressive towards her, few people dared to doubt her words.
both fans and celebrities were racing to offer their support for amber while at the same time calling for johnny to be cancelled for good.
but over the past few years, evidence against amber has piled mountain high and amber has now completely lost the public support she once enjoyed.
the fans and many of amber‚Äôs fellow celebrities are now convinced amber fabricated her accusations against johnny and orchestrated an elaborate hoax in an attempt to ruin his career.

has amber heard been finally exposed? johnny depp and amber heard‚Äôs highly-publicized legal battle has been going on for years, with no end in sight.
however, a lot of people have recently come out of the woodwork and offered evidence in support of johnny‚Äôs version of events.
after nearly having his career ruined and being fired from several big-budget projects, johnny is now being backed by disney, who has reportedly rehired him for his role as captain jack sparrow in the upcoming pirates of the caribbean movie.

amber's life has taken a downward spiral but she now takes time to thank her fans for their support. all while, johnny depp rebuilds his reputation that amber heard tried to destroy.

heard had her first major studio role in the dc extended universe superhero film justice league (2017), in which she played atlantean queen mera. she reprised that role opposite jason momoa in aquaman (2018). the same year, heard was named a global spokesperson for the cosmetics giant l'or√©al paris.

heard was married to actor johnny depp from 2015 to 2017. their divorce drew significant media attention as she alleged that he had been abusive during most of their relationship. after heard publicly discussed being the victim of domestic violence in 2018, depp sued her for defamation, alleging that she had been the abusive party. depp also sued the publishers of the sun in a related libel suit, with heard as a key witness for the defendants. in november 2020, the high court of justice of england and wales ruled that depp had lost his case and that the majority of heard's allegations had been proven to a civil standard.

in addition to acting, heard engages in activism for causes such as lgbtq rights and domestic and sexual violence awareness.",0.0,18.0,,,,,,14.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,"amber heard relaxing video yesterday, today, tomorrow, always",,,,,,,,,,

when the cut-up/edited 46 minute version leaked in january by depp‚Äôs team, it was made to portray a certain narrative and was used as propaganda. it was leaked 6 months before the trial began and used to lead people and potential jurors to believe that it was somehow an official piece of evidence, which it was not. it was incomplete.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

aquaman has been blinded in a mysterious event. years have passed and soon he regains his sight. however, damage to his land has been done. its up to him and mera to find out what happened. 

hey guys i would like to make it clear that this trailer is fan made. that means it contains clips from other movies, put together with special effects using wondershare filmora video editor and photopea (photopea.com) photo editor.

‚ñ∫what is fan made movie trailer?

in a nutshell fan made trailers are created for extreme movie fans. 
that's why its not for everybody because just like pro-wrestling, some hate it some love it. 
if you are into fan made trailers which means you appreciate bringing new ideas to your favorite movies. 
but my trailers, are not like any other, one word to describe it, realistic.

editing details:

creating aquaman 2 was challenging because i was not into this franchsie. but my dc lover side made me appreciate this film more. i watched this film once and i thought it was decent. the fresh clips are not too hard to find since there are plenty of cosplay to chose from. to avoid making this dream trailer feel low budget i chose clips from the aquaman movie it self. such as the atlantic city.

the music was great, despite the lack of humor the soundtrack by the equalizer 2 trailer #2 was great because it had lots of trailer fling to it. the main actor himself had lots of movies to chose from since this is the first time i made a project about him. not the first aquaman project though, i did one back in 2020 for one of the trailer style of the infinity saga.

the line ""is only a myth"" is great connection to how aquaman is a mystical character. the film see had great lines talking about ""gods"" that perfectly fits this dream trailer. speaking of perfectly fits, the clip with aquaman attacks the bad guy we get a transition to a guy getting attacked in the water.

1120,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t729TKvIC3k,0,0,{'Celeb District'},1,youtube,video,original video,"depp and heard met while making ‚Äúthe rum diary‚Äù in 2011, a film based on a book by hunter s. thompson. they married in february 2015, but heard filed for divorce just over a year later, and obtained a temporary restraining order against depp after accusing him of hitting her. she said at the time, according to the associated press, that she had¬†‚Äúendured excessive emotional, verbal and physical abuse‚Äù¬†in the relationship.

she withdrew those claims the day before a restraining order hearing was scheduled, and the divorce was finalized with a $7 million settlement. in a joint statement, the two declared: ‚Äúneither party has made false accusations for financial gain. there was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.‚Äù
but the allegations did not go away. the sun article appeared in april 2018. a few months later, heard published¬†an opinion piece in the washington post¬†titled, ‚Äúi spoke up against sexual violence ‚Äî and faced our culture‚Äôs wrath. that has to change.‚Äù¬†depp is suing heard for defamation in the united states¬†over that article, which he says led to him being dropped from the ‚Äúpirates of the caribbean‚Äù movie franchise.

later, heard told the court¬†that depp often put her in ‚Äúlife-threatening‚Äù situations. ‚Äúi had been for years, for years, johnny‚Äôs punching bag,‚Äù she¬†added on tuesday. on wednesday,¬†she detailed an episode¬†in australia in which she said he threw bottles at her ‚Äúlike grenades or bombs.‚Äù
in pretrial documents, heard¬†listed 14 times¬†when she said depp assaulted her.
the first occurred in early 2013, heard said in¬†a pretrial statement, when the couple was sitting on a couch talking about one of depp‚Äôs tattoos. she said it had originally read ‚Äúwinona,‚Äù in reference to winona ryder, his former partner, but that he had changed it to read ‚Äúwino.‚Äù

heard said she had laughed during the conversation, and in response depp hit her three times. ‚Äúit felt like my eye popped out,‚Äù¬†she added of the third strike, saying it knocked her off balance and to the floor.
in later incidents, heard claims, depp grabbed her by the hair, choked her, head-butted her and repeatedly punched her, on top of emotional abuse and other controlling behavior.

she also said that his behavior was ‚Äúso confusing because when he was clean and sober, he was wonderful and that part of him i loved so much.‚Äù news group newspapers ‚Äî the sun‚Äôs publisher ‚Äî claims depp‚Äôs memory of the couple‚Äôs time together has been impaired by heavy drug and alcohol use. he has admitted use of both at times in the relationship, but said his tolerance for substances was high.

depp denies the incidents. he told the court that whenever the couple had an argument he would retreat, sometimes hiding in bathrooms. ‚Äúi would try to go to my own corner, as it were,‚Äù¬†he said when asked about one incident. ‚Äúi thought it was important that we separate before things got out of hand.‚Äù witnesses including a former estate manager for depp and a former assistant to heard have testified in his favor.

depp has repeatedly portrayed heard as an aggressor, provoking arguments. in the incident in australia, depp told the court, heard threw a vodka bottle at him, severing the tip of one of his fingers.
heard denies all claims that she was violent toward him, and said that depp must have severed the fingertip himself, potentially in the process of ripping a phone off the wall and smashing it beside her face repeatedly.
at one point¬†heard admitted she had thrown ‚Äúpots and pans‚Äù at depp, but said it was ‚Äúonly to escape him.‚Äù she also acknowledged hitting him once but only to protect her sister, who she thought he was about to push down some stairs. ‚Äúi will never forget it,‚Äù¬†she said of that moment. ‚Äúit was the first time after all these years that i actually struck him back.‚Äù

mainly because at first it was made clear that johnny depp was an in the relationship, but then evidence started to pop up that it was amber heard who was the. and now, new never-before-seen evidence seems to further back up what johnny depp has been saying and as such, could further change the complexion of the case. allow us to break it down for you. be sure to like the video and subscribe to the channel!

james wan‚Äôs aquaman released in 2018 received positive reviews and its characters were praised and loved around the globe. aquaman starred jason momoa as arthur curry, amber heard as mera, willem dafoe as vulko, patrick wilson as orm the ocean master, dolph lundgren as nereus, yahya abdul-mateen ii as black manta, nicole kidman as atlanna, ludi lin as captain murk, and temuera morrison as tom curry. the applauded role played by the gorgeous amber heard has a separate fan base. however, the personal life of the actress is shadowing her professional life.

the controversial divorce of the actress with johnny depp has affected both. not all love stories have a happy ending. so was the case with aquaman's ‚Äúmera'' and ‚Äújack sparrow‚Äù of the pirates of the caribbean. they had met on the sets of ‚Äúthe rum diary‚Äù. people magazine reported that depp and heard were engaged after a picture emerged of the actress wearing an ornate engagement ring which was later confirmed by johnny depp in a video interview with the daily mail. they married in 2015 in a private ceremony. after a year heard filed a divorce case in court claiming that she is a victim of domestic abuse. on may 23, 2016, heard filed for divorce from depp and also obtained a temporary restraining order against the oscar-nominated actor. she alleged that depp had physically abused her during their relationship, and said it was usually while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. moreover, she also said that at the time of filing for divorce, an incident had recently taken place in which depp threw a phone at her leaving her with a bruised face. however, a police spokesperson told people that an investigation into the domestic incident radio call found that no crime had taken place.

depp denied these accusations and said via his representatives that heard was attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse. with the internet left polarized, the case peaked when depp lost the libel case against the sun,a tabloid newspaper in the uk. . following the sparked controversy, johnny went into hot waters and lost important roles including a role from his movie ‚Äúfantastic beasts 3‚Äù. disney also cleared that he will not be a part of the pirates of the caribbean franchise as well.

however, leaked audio and several testimonies turned the tables and showed the true colors of heard. the leaked audio call showed that the situation was otherwise and it was depp who was the victim actually, not heard!  amber heard whose beauty has mesmerized millions has been portrayed now as beauty with the evilness inside. consequently, a petition was signed by more than 1.8 million people to remove heard in aquaman. johnny‚Äôs fans were outraged and asked for justice for him as he is one of the most beloved actors in hollywood with several memorable roles.

the fans of the movie aquaman wanted the warner bros to replace her with another actress. the names suggested were emilia clarke and dakota johnson. the majority of the fans want emilia clarke as mera in aquaman 2. emilia already has a successful career and is known for her roles in the seasons game of thrones, dom hemingways, sole: a star wars story, voice from a stone, terminator genisys, etc. fan-made art of emilia as mera in aquaman 2 took twitter and other social media platforms by storm. a majority of fans found her suitable for this role and wanted to see her in the upcoming movie. an image posted by ‚Äòvalentin romero art‚Äô shows emilia clarke donned in the hexagonal suit for the mera role with an underwater crown. the suit was designed in purple color to give her costume a different look for aquaman 2.  another artist bosslogic also posted a digital artwork depicting emilia as mera. an instagram user @jph_photoshop, shared his work and the fans flooded his comment box with praise with many of them wishing that clarke could play the role.  dc marvel also shared a side-by-side image of heard and clarke as mera on his instagram handle.

when the cut-up/edited 46 minute version leaked in january by depp‚Äôs team, it was made to portray a certain narrative and was used as propaganda. it was leaked 6 months before the trial began and used to lead people and potential jurors to believe that it was somehow an official piece of evidence, which it was not. it was incomplete.

what did amber heard do to johnny depp after the divorce?
amber is one who knows when to take complete advantage of a situation and reap the most benefits out of it. she did the same with johnny by asking for a divorce settlement of 7 million, which she claimed to have given to two charities. but after the lies, that fact is quite hard to believe. 
the major blow-up of events occurred when she took advantage of the me too movement to expose johnny by labeling him as an abuser when they were married, which was just the beginning of this entire mess and of course, was quite clearly instigated by amber. whether it was for publicity or money we‚Äôll never know.
amber came out with allegation after allegation, leaving depp flabbergasted at how low amber could stoop, and for a long while kept quiet. she has faked bruises to prove her innocence, posted lies about depp‚Äôs apparent abusive nature in the washington post, and even claimed she had tried to assault her sister which we shall get into the deets of later on.",7.0,201.0,,,,,,188.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,amber heard sentenced to 5 years in prison for bribing her sister to lie in court?!,,,,,,,,,,

johnny depp‚Äôs defamation court case against amber heard just hit another snafu after briefly being held up due to global events, only recently getting the greenlight to go to trial. the new bump in the road is because amber heard‚Äôs legal team, headed up by roberta kaplan but also including john quinn, julie fink, davida brook, have quit. roberta kaplan is a well-known lawyer. she‚Äôs associated with the times up movement in los angeles and co-founded that movement‚Äôs legal defense fund. however, the defamation case against amber heard isn‚Äôt happening in los angeles.

per documents, amber heard signed off on and is fine with the change. instead of being represented by kaplan hecker and fink ll she will switch to local counsel. the organization cited ‚Äútravel and logistics‚Äù becoming ‚Äúmore costly in light of the pandemic‚Äù as the reasons for bowing out. make sure to watch the whole video and see why amber heard's lawyers quit and exposed her. in addition, do us a favor and like the video and subscribe and turn on the notification bell. we‚Äôll see you in the next video!

raven symon√© noticed amber heard in a parking lot while she was charging her tesla. they both were charging, when she noticed amber behaving strangely. raven hints at amber heard being the problem and johnny depp being the victim. i am very curious if raven is on depp's side; it appears she trolled amber heard in this video. 
the best part is she took a photo with amber.

1164,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv2DuVL1xSg,0,0,{'StarsTube'},1,youtube,video,original video,"amber heard fired from jason momoa‚Äôs blockbuster franchise following the johnny depp row

amber heard and johnny depp's divorce was major news a few months back. following the lawsuit, johnny depp had to face a lot of trouble on the professional front and his fans were not at all happy about it. depp had lost a libel case against the sun over a headline that ascribed him as a ""wife-beater."" which further resulted in warner bros. asking him to resign from fantastic beasts 3. this was not taken well by his fans who then started a petition calling for the removal of amber heard from warner bros' aquaman 2. now, rumour has it that this might become true. following the johnny depp row, petition to remove amber heard from aquaman 2 crosses 1 million signatures!

while the petition or the libel might not be the reason for amber's exit from the film, it has been learned that she indeed has been fired from the film. reports suggest that amber gained a little weight before the commencement of the shoot and the makers are not keen on continuing to work with her. not just that, it is being said that emilia clarke who i known popularly for her role as daenerys targaryen from game of thrones is all set to replace her. amber essayed the character of mera in the jason mamoa starrer.

a source told australian site sausage roll, ""amber heard did not pass her physical examination. she‚Äôs put on some pounds and is in terrible shape. there is a clause in her contract which says she is required to be in good form ahead of shooting and she violated that."" it was also revealed that amber's role was a very demanding one in terms of action and stunts and the production house terminated the contract after seeing how the actress was not in shape to take up the role. popcorned planet confirmed the same but no clarity on emilia clarke being a replacement for the actress has been given yet. fans trend 'justice for johny depp' after audio clip of amber heard admitting she hit him surfaces.

elon musk speaks against amber heard & defends johnny depp!!!

https://youtu.be/bu1uot5tyoc

amber heard ‚Äì a lot of people had no idea who she was until her divorce from johnny depp.
her biggest role by far is that of mera, in aquaman ‚Äì the love interest of none other than
aquaman himself.
the mess between amber heard and johnny depp is still ongoing, but when it first started
making headlines amber had released a phone video making johnny appear to be a
drunken ab**er.
as time went on and court trials ensued, eventually the public learned that amber was the
toxic component of the former celebrity couple. people started thinking deeply and realized
the irony of amber heard‚Äôs career. she wasn‚Äôt exactly the most well- known actress, until
she met the man who was already extremely popular in hollywood. it made so many fans
think that amber heard benefited from marrying johnny. amber started to gain more
attention in the public eye via her appearances in movies like ‚Äòjustice league‚Äô and
‚Äòaquaman‚Äô and she actually started getting more and more great roles than ever before.
amber and johnny dated for years before finally getting married in 2015, but that‚Äôs when
things started to reveal their true nature. it also made people suspicious as their marriage
lasted only one year.
jealousy, anger, ab**se, lies - the things which filled this marriage from the start and
obviously, that‚Äôs not a good combination for those who want to be a happy couple. but things
started to get intense in the worst way, when in 2016 amber filed for divorce from johnny
and also obtained a temporary restraining order against him. she alleged that johnny had
physically ab**ed her during their relationship, and said it was usually while under the
influence of dr**gs or alc***ol.
she alleged that at the time of filing for divorce, an incident had recently taken place in which
johnny depp threw his phone at her, leaving her with a bruised face.
johnny depp denied these accusations and through his representatives said amber heard
was ""attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging ab*se."" but by that
time no one believed johnny depp and his career started falling apart.
in december 2018, amber heard wrote an op-ed for the washington post saying she was
ab*sed. in this op-ed for the washington post she spoke about the treatment of women in
domestic ab*se cases.
she wrote: ""i became a public figure representing domestic ab*se, and i felt the full force of
our culture's wrath for women who speak out."" after that the newspapers labeled him as an
‚Äòab*ser‚Äô and ‚Äòwife beater‚Äô and in 2019, johnny depp sued amber heard for $50 million for
defamation over the wapo article.
the suit said that amber heard ""is not a victim of domestic ab*se, she is a perpetrator,"" and
denied that johnny depp ever ab*sed her. instead, the suit said that amber heard's
allegations were part of an ""elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity"" for the actress.

johnny depp's lawyers said: ""the op-ed depended on the central premise that ms. heard
was a domestic abuse victim and that mr. depp perpetrated domestic violence against her.""
and that‚Äôs when things really got intense and amber‚Äôs true nature started to reveal itself.
finally, amber heard‚Äôs claims of ab*se started to be revealed as false one by one. first of
all, the police spokesman revealed that an investigation into the domestic incident ‚Äòradio call‚Äô
which amber heard stated previously, found that no crime had taken place.
plus,johnny depp had his own proof that amber was lying. mainly, johnny had a recording of a time when amber ab*sed him.
in january, phone recordings obtained by the daily mail were released. in these recordings,
amber heard admitted to ""hitting"" johnny depp.
amber is heard saying: ""i'm sorry that i didn't ... hit you across the face in a proper slap, but i
was hitting you, it was not punching you. babe, you're not punched.
""i don't know what the motion of my actual hand was, but you're fine, i did not hurt you, i did
not punch you, i was hitting you.""
...
now i want to hear your opinion about amber heard. do you think she is the one who played
the victim card to get sympathy and tried to frame an innocent man? let me know what you
think in the comments section down below.

subscribe to viral network  üëâ https://youtube.com/user/zrul90

actress amber heard, who recently went through a public and contentious divorce and legal dispute with ex-husband johnny depp, is now publicly responding to depp's followers on social media who have been sending her derogatory comments amidst the former couple's continued legal battles.

for those unaware, johnny's ex-girlfriends were named in a lawsuit against the sun for branding him a ""wife-beater."" johnny's effort to get the case retried in the uk was futile after the two raised their respective sides. in the united states, a slander case is already due to be heard this year. depp sued heard for slander in virginia after she penned an op-ed for the washington post in 2018 in which she described herself as a domestic violence victim, though she never listed depp by name. the actor is claiming damages in the amount of usd 50 million.

after the suit was held in amber's favor, the aqua man actress took to twitter to brand johnny's lawyer ""short,"" and she's now sent tweets to fans who are against her. ‚Äúi'd rather be short than an abusive gold digger,‚Äù one fan responded to the diss. ‚Äúit's nice to be objective about your goals,‚Äù amber replied.

i am a natural born psychic under the zodiac sign of pisces. i have travelled the world extensively demonstrating my extraordinary ability to thousands during live shows, private readings, and youtube videos, where anything can happen and shockingly detailed. i have scared myself at times with the level of accuracy i deliver, check out my past videos. i am fascinated by meghan and harry's antics since they departed the royal family. that is why i started my youtube channel and of course it demonstrates my ability to give extraordinary insight into meghan and harry‚Äôs lives. they are ideal material for such talented psychics because you never know what is coming next and you certainly cannot predict them unless of course you are watching my videos! 
since launching my channel september 2020, i have been amazed at the level of views and subscriptions i have received in such a short time, my channel may be new but as a psychic i have been reading professionally for over 30 years, so i thank you so much for your lovely comments and clicks!!!! as you can see my channel continues to evolve as do my technical skills. anyone will know that editing and running a youtube channel is very time consuming and quite hard work at times, but i absolutely love it, i really do!! very kindly i have had more than a few requests to attach a link so you can buy me a coffee??? i felt uncomfortable at first, but the truth is i have some wonderful subscribers who see me as a new friend. you feel like you are getting to know me, as i do you. i listen to my subscribers, and i love to interact with you through my videos, live chat, and comments so even though it makes me a little uncomfortable to accept a coffee, apparently it makes you feel good. for a lot of viewers, you will no doubt be in some financial difficulty, and i am afraid buying me a coffee will not bring you financial gain. other less reputable psychics will claim if you donate you will get thousands back in karma. life doesn‚Äôt work like that unfortunately, otherwise i‚Äôd be a rich woman. keep your money to yourself. a nice comment from you will suffice and feels just as good. now for those wanting to buy me a coffee- i do not drink fancy coffees! however due to a medical condition that makes my mouth goes extremely dry (you can tell in my videos sometimes) i love nothing more than a sugar free slush puppy. as i drink quite a lot, i‚Äôve gone off certain cordials and juices, but i always enjoy a slush puppy‚Ä¶. so, here‚Äôs the link guys.

1219,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79GX1RNB4B8,0,0,{'Motivator Network'},1,youtube,video,original video,"movie: amber heard vs johnny depp's deception, violence, & agents. many actresses were on blackcube's hit list, including rose mcgowan. although elon musk rushed in to help after high-profile violence, amber heard faces depp's agent adam waldman - who represented steele's dossier, an oligarch in organized crime, and targeted julian assange for election interference. support amber heard's life!

why is amber heard's story beginning to sound like a ""007 flemming's novel"" to an artificial intelligence auditor?

within death threats & bots online - tech a part of 21st century story - waldman refers to homeland security as depp & waldman claim amber created a 'dossier.' in parallels, 10 years ago actress brittany murphy and julia davis were targeted, severely monitored for testifying on border control issues of homeland security.
brittany murphy lost her roles in happy feet 2 & died suddenly.
amber heard is targeted to remove her from aquaman 2 and to kill her.

rose mcgowan states weinstein hired agents who pretended they were journalists and in victim's support groups. they terrified dozens of actresses.

high-volume bots: similarly, intense real-time monitoring pages occurs for amber heard online with ai bots likely using nlu/nlg, ""i am"" persona dialogue - open source on github 2017-2020. ilm/alex context based on previous text dialogues is beyond a
2021 social network analysis paper using google's bert: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9385071
in irony - elon musk's openai gpt-2 or gpt-3 - https://github.com/harperreed/gpt3-persona-bot - likely being used against his ex girlfriend, amber heard.

witnesses have been threatened with death, as we were alerted to nearly 2 years ago when an alleged partner of ex-staff claimed depp's agents wanted to make lies about amber heard's trips to tijuana and targeting her humanitarian work. their goal is to destroy her & it was the tip of the iceberg.

j. depp is incited by an audience to terminate president trump at his suggestion. 
then we see amber heard (b&w) & elon musk.

depp harms amber heard with coercive control - a level of understanding now understood about domestic violence in australia, new zealand, and the united kingdom. 
the united kingdom is where amber won in the ngn trial proving she was a victim of violence in at least 12 out of 14 incidents.

audio clips, which were cut out of timed leaks, from incredibly incredible's channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucjknc-woalnxt0h-yj8rxjg - are shown to provide context to coercive control. 
from 60 minutes, a woman in australia who eventually called the police is told by a corrupt officer that she shouldn't have texted, in writing, about her husband's temper during intoxication that pushes him over the edge as it would trigger an investigation.

in 2016, amber and io finally called the police after fearing for her life. officers went to depp's 5 penthouses in downtown los angeles which we show with a pool, numerous rooms, and abusive paintings on the walls which people walk by and ignore.

""what happened on private jets and islands between amber heard and johnny depp?"" was it really broadcasted, or was it silenced and twisted?

""hey @mariannaspring [bbc], after i discovered the connection between johnny depp attorney adam waldman & a vladimir putin-connected russian oligarch 16 months ago, i postulated the theory depp's team was using bots to influence public opinion on his case."" - the geek buzz, july 28, 2020

""twitter can be a hostile place,‚Äù.... ‚Äúthe online attacks in respect of amber have been far worse than anything i experienced during the julian assange case.‚Äù - financial times - jennifer robinson, assange's lawyer of 10 years, had to be hired by amber heard. waldman met with assange to target him at least 7 times. 
we show a political clip showing texts between waldman and senator warner of virginia about steele's dossier.
many sna analysts are military.

""... it's a hoax by adam ""former lobbyist for russian putin lackey oleg deripaska who sought complete immunity in the us senate russian 2016 hacking hearings"" waldman."" - the geek buzz, july 29, 2020 (bots & personality?)

""new legal claims filed against johnny depp for targeting his ex-wife on social media, specifically through the alleged deployment of ""bots"" to smear her and interfere with her career opportunities."" - eric gardner, hollywood reporter

""rottentomatoes, imdb, metacritic have all all changed their online methods to post reviews because of it. again, very similar patterns and, frankly, targets. in 2016, the target was hillary clinton. in the case of review bombing, the target was female-fronted films."" - the geek buzz, july 28, 2020

the american actor, producer and musician, johnny depp, lost a high-profile libel action against the sun newspaper. as a result, mr. depp will now forever be associated with the term ‚Äòwife beater‚Äô¬†which is already having consequences for his career, and his former wife, amber heard, will have to continue to live with the impact of past domestic abuse. today we are going to be talking about the crazy relationship of johnny depp and amber heard. hey everyone and welcome back to celeb mania! make sure you stay until the end as you don‚Äôt want to miss the best and craziest part of the relationship between johnny depp and amber heard.

heard met depp while filming¬†the rum diary¬†in 2009, and they began living together the following year.¬†they were married in a private civil ceremony at their home in los angeles on february 3, 2015.¬†in april 2015, heard and depp breached australia's¬†insecurity¬†laws when they failed to declare their two¬†yorkshire terriers¬†to the¬†australian customs service¬†when they flew by private jet into¬†queensland, where he was working on¬†pirates of the caribbean: dead men tell no tales.¬†heard pleaded guilty to falsifying quarantine documents, stating that she had made a mistake due to sleep deprivation.¬†she was placed on a $1,000 one-month¬†good behavior bond¬†for producing a false document;¬†heard and depp also released a video in which they apologized for their behavior and urged people to adhere to the insecurity laws.¬†the guardian¬†called the case the ""highest-profile criminal quarantine case"" in australian history.

depp was born on june 9, 1963,¬†in¬†owensboro, kentucky,¬†the youngest of four children of waitress betty sue palmer (n√©e¬†wells)¬†and civil engineer john christopher depp.¬†depp moved frequently during his childhood, he and his siblings lived in more than 20 different places, eventually settling in¬†miramar, florida¬†in 1970.¬†depp's parents divorced in 1978 when he was 15,¬†his mother married robert palmer, whom depp has called ""an inspiration"". at the 2016 grammys, depp played a song in tribute to palmer, stating, ""so the words of the song were this toast by my stepfather, who made his exit about 15 years ago, he was this really cool guy. he was a bit of a rounder; he spent about half his life in prison, in¬†statesville, illinois. with the gift of a guitar from his mother when he was 12, depp began playing in various bands.¬†a year after his parents' divorce, he dropped out of¬†miramar high school¬†to become a rock musician; he attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician,¬†he played with the kids, a band that enjoyed modest local success, from 1980 to 1984. the kids set out together for los angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing their name to six gun method, but the group split up before signing a record deal. depp subsequently collaborated with the band¬†rock city angels. depp married lori anne allison,¬†the sister of his band's bassist and singer. 

heard was born in¬†austin, texas, to patricia paige (n√©e¬†parsons), an internet researcher (1956‚Äì2020), and david clinton heard (born 1950), who owned a small construction company.¬†she has a younger sister, whitney.¬†the family lived outside austin.¬†heard's father broke horses in his free time, and she grew up riding horses, hunting, and fishing with him.¬†she also participated in beauty pageants, although as an adult she has said that she can no longer ""support the objectification"".¬†heard, who was raised¬†catholic, subsequently declared herself as an¬†atheist.¬†at the age of 17, she no longer felt comfortable in texas¬†and dropped out of her catholic high school to move to new york city.¬†she eventually earned a diploma through a home-study course.¬†in new york, she supported herself by modeling¬†but soon moved to los angeles to pursue acting. she made her film debut in a minor role in the sports drama¬†friday night lights¬†(2004), followed by brief supporting roles in films such as¬†drop dead sexy¬†(2005),¬†north country¬†(2005),¬†side fx¬†(2005),¬†price to pay¬†(2006),¬†you are here¬†(2006), and¬†alpha dog¬†(2006), and a guest-starring spot in an episode of the¬†police procedural¬†criminal minds. heard received her first leading role in the unconventional¬†slasher film¬†all the boys love mandy lane,

hey guys i would like to make it clear that this trailer is fan made. that means it contains clips from other movies, put together with special effects using wondershare filmora video editor and photopea (photopea.com) photo editor.

‚ñ∫what is fan made movie trailer?

in a nutshell fan made trailers are created for extreme movie fans. that's why its not for everybody because just like pro-wrestling, some hate it some love it. if you are into fan made trailers which means you appreciate bringing new ideas to your favorite movies. but my trailers, are not like any other, one word to describe it, realistic.

creating aquaman 2 was challenging because i was not into this franchsie. but my dc lover side made me appreciate this film more. i watched this film once and i thought it was decent. the fresh clips are not too hard to find since there are plenty of cosplay to chose from. to avoid making this dream trailer feel low budget i chose clips from the aquaman movie it self. such as the atlantic city.

the music was great, despite the lack of humor the soundtrack by the equalizer 2 trailer #2 was great because it had lots of trailer fling to it. the main actor himself had lots of movies to chose from since this is the first time i made a project about him. not the first aquaman project though, i did one back in 2020 for one of the trailer style of the infinity saga.

the line ""is only a myth"" is great connection to how aquaman is a mystical character. the film see had great lines talking about ""gods"" that perfectly fits this dream trailer. speaking of perfectly fits, the clip with aquaman attacks the bad guy we get a transition to a guy getting attacked in the water.

politics and accountability anchor libby casey interviews thirty-six colleagues about their work, including political reporters assigned to cover the campaign, the washington post‚Äôs director of polling, and the washington post fact checker. they talk about the challenges facing president-elect joe biden to unite and run the country, questions surrounding the future of both the democratic and republican parties, and the need for vice president-elect kamala harris to show americans what she offers to the electorate. 

the washington post journalists also focus on president donald trump and his continued role defining the republican party, even after he leaves office on january 20th, 2021. the journalists share their goals going forward, including closely covering hispanic and asian voter registration, and why the ‚Äúyouthquake‚Äù predicted by bernie sanders didn‚Äôt turn out at the polls. they also discuss their concerns about misinformation and the country‚Äôs divisions. the team digs into polling and discusses how it should be used in political coverage. libby casey also asks how the reporters did their jobs amid the coronavirus pandemic, which restricted travel and meeting with voters.

lockdown has seen people go to quite extreme lengths in order to get what they want. for some, the idea of staying home and waiting for all this to pass isn‚Äôt such a big deal. for others, one day of being locked up in their homes is enough to make them want to escape their new found living hell. either way, to say that these unprecedented times have led to people doing things they likely normally wouldn‚Äôt do, is pretty accurate. and that is exactly what happened to dale mclaughlan, who has been sent to jail for a month after breaking coronavirus lockdown protocols.

a petition seeking to have amber heard removed from warner bros.' aquaman 2 recently surpassed 1.5 million signatures.

the change.org petition was created several years ago, in the wake of heard's messy divorce from johnny depp and reports that both actors were physically violent during their tumultuous relationship. the petition is addressed to courtney simmons, svp of publicity & communications for dc warner bros. and paul mcguire, corporate communications of dc entertainment.

it read in part, ""in his $50 million lawsuit, johnny depp describes many incidents of domestic abuse that he suffered at the hands of his (then) wife amber heard, including one incident where she punched him twice in the face and another where she shattered his finger with a vodka bottle, and his finger had to be surgically reattached. he will bear the scar from that for the rest of his life.""

the author of the petition further explained that heard ""was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, tasya van ree"" and alleged that the actor has ""systematically crusaded to ruin depp in hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused johnny depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser.""

it was reported back in 2019 that depp had called on warner bros. to remove heard from the first aquaman film, in which she portrayed superheroine and warrior mera. however, this didn't come to pass, and heard recently confirmed she will reprise the role in the upcoming sequel. the petition started trending again -- and currently sits at 1.6 million signatures -- after depp lost a libel case in early november against the sun.

following the ruling on the libel case, which was over a headline that referred to depp as a ""wife beater,"" warner bros. asked the actor to resign from fantastic beasts 3. while depp obliged, the nature of his contract means warner bros. still needs to pay the actor's $10 million salary, as he'd already filmed a scene. depp tried to appeal the case, but judge andrew nicol ruled against him last week. nicol denied depp's appeal because he determined it did not have ""a reasonable prospect of success."" the judge also ruled that the actor must pay an initial ¬£628,000 ($837,437) in legal fees to the sun.

directed by james wan, aquaman 2 stars jason momoa as aquaman, amber heard as mera, patrick wilson as ocean master and yahya abdul-mateen ii as black manta. the film is currently scheduled to arrive in theaters on dec. 16, 2022.",0.0,24.0,,,,,,24.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,petition to remove amber heard from aquaman 2 surpasses 1.5 million signatures,,,,,,,,,,

description:

if you have followed the famous johnny depp amber heard and the sun uk ‚Äúwife beater‚Äù case, one thing is for sure, there was physical altercation from both sides while the couple was in a relationship. 
what is attack and what is defense was subjective and the only person who had a say on this was the london high court judge, but what happened after that? 

one of the most unethical workplace, yes you guessed it right, hollywood, that has continued for years with people like harvey weinstein, kevin spacey, people with past drug dealing history, a place for casting couch and misogyny has decided to play the moral police. 
johnny depp is losing projects after project and on the other side amber heard is using this opportunity to mint money. 

one more interesting fact is that the fan following of johnny is increasing every day and yes we don‚Äôt mean fans who appreciated his acting, that has already been huge, but these are the fans who really feel johnny is getting an unfair treatment. on the other side amber heard is getting equal amount of hate. 

but it seems, she knows this is an opportunity and she is busy making the most of it, she is giving lectures on domestic violence, may be because she survived it and wants to change the world to be a better place, yeah only after charging $ 33000. 

here is the quote from the source article: 

out of everything you might think amber heard has lost, it is undoubtedly not work. the actor holds her ground in all her projects regardless of the massive hatred she is subjected to by the online users. while she still stands strong and continues to get on board for more movies, the latest reports tell us that she has unlocked one more money-minting avenue in her life. heard has been roped by an agency to give talks on domestic violence and her remuneration for a single session is huge for just talking.

now you might be wondering if there was a physical altercation from both sides, why is amber heard even being heard on domestic violence and paid hefty sums. well it will take us back to where we started, attack and defense. 

on the other hand, same day you read about johnny depp being blocked from the project he made iconic. 

according to the daily mail uk, the entertainment conglomerate had distanced itself from the 57-year-old actor even before his 'wife beater' libel trial in the uk. 
also the report says disney 'balked' at executive producer jerry bruckheimer's idea of bringing back depp for a cameo in the female-centric spin-off of the franchise, rumored to be led by margot robbie.

now we don‚Äôt know what is true and what they are making up, but everything happening together and the contrast we see on how the two are dealt with makes me wonder if the new normal is court passing a judgment and big firms deciding how to punish and reward people. 

specially hollywood that has made money over years portraying that the character has done something wrong in front of the law, works through it, make changes, hustles and come out as a better and more successful person.  

what do you think? has hollywood lost the hope it has been selling for years.

when the cut-up/edited 46 minute version leaked in january by depp‚Äôs team, it was made to portray a certain narrative and was used as propaganda. it was leaked 6 months before the trial began and used to lead people and potential jurors to believe that it was somehow an official piece of evidence, which it was not. it was incomplete.

there are few people who know celebrities and people in power as well as their assistants. they know everything about their schedules, who they are seeing, who they don't want to see and what they act like when the camera‚Äôs aren't rolling. which is why, if you ever get famous or rich, you should make sure you treat your assistant with a ton of kindness and respect.

johnny depp ‚Äúdid not receive a fair trial‚Äù and the high court ruling that stated he assaulted his ex-wife amber heard and put her in fear for her life is ‚Äúplainly wrong‚Äù, lawyers for the hollywood star have told the court of appeal.

the 57-year-old sued the sun over a column by its executive editor, dan wootton, which referred to ‚Äúoverwhelming evidence‚Äù that he had attacked heard, 34, during their relationship and described him as a ‚Äúwife beater‚Äù.
in the initial ruling, last month, mr justice nicol dismissed depp‚Äôs claim, saying the paper‚Äôs owner, news group newspapers, had proved what was in the article to be ‚Äúsubstantially true‚Äù.
dismissing depp‚Äôs libel case, nicol found that 12 of the 14 alleged incidents of domestic violence relied on by ngn did occur. the judge said depp put heard ‚Äúin fear of her life‚Äù during what she described as a ‚Äúthree-day hostage situation‚Äù in australia in march 2015.
depp‚Äôs barrister, david sherborne, has asked the appeal court to ‚Äúset aside the judgment and order a new trial‚Äù if permission to appeal against nicol‚Äôs judgment is given. in documents filed with the appeal court on thursday, depp‚Äôs lawyers claimed nicol‚Äôs ruling was ‚Äúmanifestly unsafe‚Äù.
depp‚Äôs legal team claim nicol ‚Äúfailed to undertake any, or an adequate analysis, of ms heard‚Äôs shifting account, despite the importance of consistency as a consideration of a witness‚Äôs testimony‚Äù.
sherborne, said nicol ‚Äúconcluded that the appellant was guilty of serious physical assaults without taking account of or even acknowledging that ms heard had been untruthful in her evidence, without testing her account against the documentary evidence and the evidence of other witnesses, and without making any findings that he disbelieved those witnesses‚Äù.
the barrister also argued: ‚Äúthe conclusion which flows from an overall assessment of the judgment is that (mr justice nicol) decided to find for the ‚Äòvictim‚Äô but failed to provide the necessary analysis to explain or justify that conclusion.
‚Äúalso he excluded relevant evidence from his consideration, ignored or dismissed as irrelevant matters that substantially undermined ms heard, made findings unsupported by the evidence, and failed to assess whether her allegations could withstand proper scrutiny",12.0,58.0,,,,,,43.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,johnny dep didn't get a fair lawsuit,,,,,,,,,,

while the hits keep coming for johnny depp in his continuing estrangement battles against his ex-wife, this time she‚Äôs coming for his most iconic role.
 
in today‚Äôs video are going to tell about amber heard reportedly in talks for ‚Äòpirates of the caribbean‚Äô reboot
 
johnny depp, now 55, and amber heard, 32, met on the set of the rum diary in 2011 and commenced dating fresh off his relationship with vanessa paradis. depp and heard's marriage was short-lived, only lasting from february 2015 until she filed for divorce in may 2016.

amber heard and johnny depp: the dramatic divorcee gift that keeps on giving. just a few years ago, johnny depp was one of the highest-paid actors on the planet, but allegations of violence made him box office poison. petitions calling for his removal from the pirates of the caribbean and fantastic beasts franchises emerged. depp, during a lawsuit against his ex-wife amber heard, claimed that her allegations had hurt his career. while the role of grindelwald is that the sole career casualty he‚Äôs faced so far in his epic years-long showdown with heard, depp‚Äôs legendary status as captain jack sparrow could even be commandeered by his estranged ex-wife. not only is she keeping her role in aquaman 2, but she will even be within the running for a task within the new pirates of the caribbean reboot. if this information is true, she would be joining ranks with margot robbie‚Äôs pirates reboot, promising ‚Äúlots of girl power.‚Äù

while it‚Äôs unclear if the actress has had talks with the studio just yet about it, or if she‚Äôs only discussed it with the birds of prey star at this stage, booting depp from pirates of the caribbean then drafting heard in to sail the body of water instead would little question send the online into a fit of rage? that being said, within the eyes of the law, amber is technically the victim here, and if warner bros is willing to possess her headline a significant blockbuster.

johnny depp continues to receive blows after losing his appeal against the united kingdom‚Äôs court ruling on the sun‚Äôs ‚Äòwife-beater‚Äô defamation case. new reports have circulated stating that aquaman star amber heard is talking with margot robbie to hitch depp‚Äôs former franchise.

while this is often ready to be a huge blow to depp, we‚Äôre unsure jerry bruckheimer, producer of pirates and longtime friend of the actor, would allow such disrespect. fans are also on depp‚Äôs side, with nearly 350,000 signatures on a petition to bring him back because of the famed captain. heard has her own, not so flattering petition to fireside her from aquaman, which claims quite 1.5 million signatures.

the new developments in depp and heard‚Äôs careers still unfold while their legal battle ensues. it's interesting to determine how things would find yourself later and if heard‚Äôs movies will receive the impact of the involves boycotts that fans are campaigning for. the pirates of the caribbean sixth installment with margot robbie remains in development. disney dropped johnny depp from the pirates of the caribbean franchise four days after amber heard's op-ed within the washington post, his attorneys allege, which they see the events as connected.

johnny depp's lawyers just filed a $50 million defamation suit against amber heard, arguing her abuse allegations ""were a neighborhood of an elaborate hoax to urge positive publicity for ms. heard and advance her career."" since the op-ed was published on december 18, the lawsuit also suggests it had been done to help promote her film aquaman.

what are your views all about? are you disappointed that the jack sparrow actor won‚Äôt be making an appearance in any future pirates of the caribbean installments, or are you happy with disney‚Äôs decision to cut ties with the alleged abuser? let us know your thoughts in the comments section below and if you haven‚Äôt subscribed to my channel yet, please do so. see you in the next video.

#amberheard's counterclaim filed in august 2020 counters with breaking a law in virginia against harassment via #computer:

""10. as part of his ongoing smear campaign, mr. depp and/or his agents acting on his behalf have directed both authentic and inauthentic social media accounts, and/or non-human controlled ‚Äúbots,‚Äù to target ms. heard. .. the talking points in these accounts are strikingly similar but use slightly different text and content to evade [detection]
11. there are a number of newly created... accounts specifically or predominantly designed to damage ms. heard. many of these accounts have cyrillic signatures...
...which inauthentic accounts... amplify, which further evidence a coordinated smear campaign...
16. mr. depp, through his agents and attorneys in virginia, including specifically waldman, have engaged in a campaign to harass and damages ms. heard through the use of computers and computer accessible vehicles.

this conduct also has the potential effect of polluting  the jury  pool ....
37. in december 2018, ms. heard published an op-ed in the washington post calling for ‚Äúchanges to laws and rules and social norms‚Äù

it perpetuates abuse towards #women and other victims #online who have gone into the crossfires.

johnny depp attempted to have ex-wife amber heard replaced on aquaman. depp and heard were married from 2015-2017, and their relationship continues to have a major impact on the entertainment industry. the two made headlines for legal issues both during and after their marriage. last month, depp lost a lawsuit against the sun, which called him a ""wifebeater"" in a 2018 article. following this decision, depp was asked to resign from the upcoming film fantastic beasts and where to find them 3, where he was to reprise his role as gellert grindelwald. despite only filming one scene, depp received millions for his work on the movie.

following depp's exit from the fantastic beasts franchise, a subset of fans have similarly called for heard to be fired from aquaman 2. the actor starred as mera in the first movie and will play the part again in the sequel. last month, a petition titled ""remove amber heard from aquaman 2"" was started on change.org. it quickly surpassed one million signatures and now sits at over 1.7 million. shortly after, heard debunked rumors mera would be recast in the film, stating, ""i'm excited to get started next year."" now, it seems those who signed the petition aren't the only ones who had an interest in having heard replaced in the aquaman franchise.

according to a new article from thr, at one point, depp told his sister, christi dembrowski, a producer with pull at warner bros., that he wanted heard ""replaced on the wb film."" in the process of the trial, depp revealed the film in question was aquaman.

the reveal about depp comes after a similar report last year alleged the same. though this more concrete information is shocking, it also lines up with what's already known about depp and heard's volatile relationship. ultimately, it seems depp's attempts to interfere with heard's career amounted to nothing, as the actor remained a part of aquaman. still, the news is disconcerting to say the least, especially considering the power depp once wielded in the industry. it's clear he was willing to use any sway he had against heard, which is troubling.

it remains to be seen if this reveal about depp will have any impact on heard's future in the dc extended universe. if anything, it seems to reinforce warner bros' commitment to heard. if depp did follow through with contacting the studio through his sister, apparently his request was denied. though there have been new developments in the last year or so, this could bode well for heard's role in the next aquaman movie.",0.0,29.0,,,,,,24.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,johnny depp tried to get amber heard replaced on aquaman,,,,,,,,,,

16. mr. depp, through his agents and attorneys in virginia, including specifically waldman, have engaged in a campaign to harass and damages ms. heard through the use of computers and computer accessible vehicles.

this conduct also has the potential effect of polluting  the jury  pool ....

as amber heard‚Äòs and johnny depp‚Äôs explosive divorce continues to escalate, friends, family, and celebrities are throwing their support behind each star. on may 23, 2016, heard was granted a short lived restraining order against her husband of 15 months, alleging in court documents that the 52-year-old actor physically abused her throughout their four-year relationship.

celebrities and friends weigh in on the couple's split, and heard's allegations she was physically abused by depp. 

in today‚Äôs video are going to tell about 5 celebrities who defended amber heard. 

5) io tillett wright
artist, actor, and activist io wright maybe a friend of heard who purportedly came to her defense during heard‚Äôs alleged altercation with depp on saturday. consistent with heard‚Äôs court filings, depp demanded heard call wright to ‚Äúprove his paranoid and irrational accusations about some delusional idea he was having.‚Äù heard claims johnny then ‚Äúripped the telephone from my hand and commenced screaming profanities and insults at io.‚Äù

‚Äúi heard io yell at me to urge out of the house,‚Äù heard stated. ‚Äújohnny then grabbed the telephone, aroused his arms sort of a baseball pitcher, and threw the telephone at me striking my cheek and eye with great force.‚Äù

‚Äúi immediately covered my face and was crying due to the pain resulting from the phone hitting me. johnny charged at me, insisting on seeing my face. he taunted me, challenged whether or not the telephone hit me. he then forcibly pulled back my hair as i attempted to face up from the sofa. i then yelled out ‚Äòcall 911‚Äô hoping it might be heard by io who was still on the phone. johnny continued screaming at me, pulling my hair, striking me, and violently grabbing my face,‚Äù heard alleged

4) samantha spector
high-profile attorney samantha spector, who represented morena baccarin in her litigation with ex austin chick, is heard‚Äôs lawyer.

‚Äúunfortunately, this is often not the primary incident of violence perpetrated by johnny against amber,‚Äù spector writes in court documents obtained by people. ‚Äúthere are two other incidents within the past six months. although amber is scared of johnny, she strongly insists that we do everything possible to stay this personal matter out of the media spotlight.‚Äù

3) amanda de cadenet
while british chat show host amanda de cadenet hasn‚Äôt released a political statement, the 44-year-old retweeted several messages of support for heard on friday and saturday.

one day after heard claimed she was abused by depp, de cadenet shared a photograph of herself with heard and model-turned-actress amber valletta during de cadenet‚Äôs may 23 birthday celebration. within the photo, which has since been deleted, heard is seen smiling but together with her hair placed over half her face.

2) evan rachel wood
who? actress, known for true blood, mildred pierce and therefore the ides of march.
in a tweet that was later deleted, wood seemed to criticize the way some media outlets had written about heard's sexuality: ‚Äúamber heard‚Äòs sexuality is merely relevant therein bi women are at far greater risk of experiencing intimate partner violence. bisexuality however isn't a reason for violence. it doesn‚Äôt mean heard is somehow immoral or deserving of abuse.‚Äù

1)andy richter
who? comedy star and screenwriter, known for his work on the talk show conan. on may 28, 2016, richter suggested that depp and his representatives might be attempting to fire up bad publicity for heard.

on may 28, 2016, he tweeted that, one among the items you'll pay a publicist try to form your ex look bad within the press after you have been accused of abuse.

what do you think about the allegations filed by heard? does johnny hit her? let us know your thoughts in the comments below and if you haven‚Äôt subscribed to my channel yet, please do so. see you in the next video.

there have been lockdowns and restrictions put into place all over the world, and though a lot of us are tired of it, its still important to follow the rules to keep yourself and your loved ones as safe as possible. so when you're travelling, its still important to self isolate and to monitor your symptoms and interactions with others, and above all, do not do what this girl did. skylar mack, a teenager from georgia decided to travel to the cayman islands to visit her boyfriend and watch him compete in a jet ski competition.

______________________________________________

______________________________________________
it has been weeks since johnny depp has lost his libel trial against 'the sun' which went on to accuse depp on the grounds of being a 'wife-beater'. this not only tormented his character but also got him cancelled from a lot of upcoming projects. needless to say, we feel really sorry for depp. however, it is not only johnny depp who tried to warn us about amber heard. 

in this video, we are going to be taking a look at 5 celebrities who tried to warn us about amber heard. 

5. wynona ryder: 
well, we knew she'd be on this list. wynona very famously dated johnny depp from 1989-1993. while the couple had a sweet yet messy relationship, they didn't really last long together due to the incompatibility between them. however, their friendship has stood the test of time and they have always went on to support each other. so when the situation with amber heard actually popped up, wynona didn't hesitate to defend johnny depp by saying that her personal experience with johnny depp has been really wonderful. he has always been kind and helpful and hasn't showed any signs of violent behavior. 

4. sia: 
sia's statements on support johnny depp have been the most recent we have seen any celebrity voice up for depp's defense. however, the singer surprised everyone when she voiced her support for johnny depp unexpectedly on twitter. she started off by posting a video which included the leaked audio of amber heard talking about how she had lost it on johnny in the past and then she went on to make this confession which made things even more clearer. sia tweeted that although she doesn't like depp for sporting a lot of unnecessary jewelry, it is very much clear that depp has been a victim here and needs to be supported during tough times. but sia wasn't even done when she called out heard's ex-boyfriend elon musk accusing him of supporting amber heard and that all of them shouldn't stay silent. 

3. alysson paradis: 
paradis family has clearly been a fan of johnny depp for a long time and it is quite evident that alysson paradis did not shy away from voicing her support in favor of johnny depp. she went on to show her support in the form of an instagram post which showcased the two together with the caption stating depp would always have a family in the name of paradis' and that depp's one of the funniest and comical guys one can ever meet. so if depp's in-laws are actually going this far to support him, something about amber heard is definitely not right. 

2. lily rose depp: 
lily rose depp did not stray even an inch when it came to protecting her father against the claims that had been made against him. she first posted a screenshot of an article from people which showed that lapd had went to the couple's place however the police did not really find any concrete evidence of any crime going on. then, she also went on to post a picture of her and her dad when she was just a baby captioning the photo by voicing her support for her father and that he's the best father and that she's very lucky to have him. 

1. laura divenere: 
while being a former friend of amber heard, laura actually did the right thing by voicing her statement against amber heard in the court of law stating that she didn't see heard's bruises after an alleged fight between heard and depp on may 21st, 2016. even though amber heard tried to release a recording making the accusation false, depp's lawyers included an e-mail after the recording stating that divenere had never seen bruises on heard's body.

the lapd, who were called to the home on may 21, 2016 in relation to the ‚Äòphone throwing‚Äô incident, stated they saw nothing out of place and nothing wrong with heard other than she appeared to have been crying and her face was flushed. they also had no idea the call involved johnny depp as the call was placed under the name heard. the 911 call log shows him as being named johnny heard. when they arrived, heard and her friends refused to give any more details on him, his whereabouts, or his identity. they found nothing wrong and heard alleged a verbal disagreement so they left their business card with her and departed. not widely reported is that some hours later another set of police arrived and also saw nothing. two separate calls, four different officers, and nothing amiss.

amber heard has been in the news so much this year. a lot of the controversy she‚Äôs been involved in has to do with her involvement with johnny depp‚Äôs libel case against the sun publication. this year she's gotten a lot of media attention and we saw a lot of dirt come out that painted a very different picture than what we previously interpreted of their marriage, but this isn't the only picture that faced a lot of backlashes.

welcome to the heavy spoilers show, i'm your host paul and i dunno if it's just me but does anyone else think the stand is randall lagging a bit after episode 3?

i think by far this was my least favourite of those released and i found the time jumps to be a bit all over the place. if you're confused by exactly what's going on then don't worry as we're gonna be breaking it all down and discussing the main book differences.

obviously full spoilers ahead from here on out though i will keep some of the bigger elements of the book a secret to not spoil some certain surprises. if you enjoy the video please smash the thumbs up button and make sure you subscribe for breakdowns of the series every week.

with that out the way, happy new year, i'm your host paul now let's get into the breakdown!

ok so episode 3 sort of fills in the back stories of some of the side characters that we've been introduced to and primarily we focus on nadine, nick and stu meeting glen bateman.

now you may remember that last week we caught nadine being drawn towards a planchette and this episode we see that the device ties back to her childhood. similar to the source material, nadine was an orphan but rather than living with her aunt and uncle like in the book we see her starting off in a home.

through the planchette, randall flagg is able to contact her and he clearly has had eyes on her from a young age. the villain carves into the floor ""nadine will be my queen, we are in the house of the dead nadine"" which yeah...you can have her mate.

now even in her adult version, nadine is still a virgin and this is because throughout her life flagg has contacted her and told her to save herself for him. though many men have shot their shot some dark force has always swept in and scared them off.

in the present we catch her waking up in bed and to everyone's surprise amber heard hasn't pooped in it.

We hope the world online becomes more <em>equal</em> for women!</strong></p>
<p><em>The Times</em>: ""She has become a vocal campaigner on the issue of domestic and sexual abuse as an ambassador for <em><strong>women‚Äôs rights</strong></em> for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).""</p>
<p><em>The Sun</em>: ""On November 2, following a four-week trial, a judge ruled that the allegations against Depp, 57, were<strong> ‚Äúsubstantially true‚Äù and that he was violent towards Amber.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Domestic violence charities have hailed the outcome a victory</strong></em> that will hopefully encourage other victims to speak out and seek justice.</p>
<p>Karen Ingala Smith, CEO of domestic violence charity Nia, praised Amber‚Äôs courage, saying: <strong>‚ÄúI would like to acknowledge the bravery of Heard in naming the abuse that she was subjected to.‚Äù</strong>""</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hollywood Reporter, further, showed that Amber's ex, Depp, sent an abusive voicemail to his first wife, Lori, requiring a $1.25 million settlement in ""<a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/hes-radioactive-inside-johnny-depps-self-made-implosion"" rel=""nofollow"">He's Radioactive</a>.""</li>
</ul>
<p>""Sources say he paid his first wife, Lori Anne Allison, $1.25 million to keep quiet after he allegedly left a long ranting message in which he repeatedly used the N-word. The previously unreported settlement was accomplished using fictitious names to avoid scrutiny, with Richard Green serving as the stand-in for Johnny Depp.""</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, <strong>the online warfare to demean progress for women worldwide</strong> - people of my team know that female leaders in South America were removed because of online cyberabuse - continues.</em></p>
<p>Amber Heard may be in entertainment, but she's historically been highly political, highly an activist, and a humanitarian.</p>
<p>Contrary to former belief, the social technology companies are not liberal on the backend. Stereotypes abound against women and internationals in their training and actions, which is backed up by repeated people defying their NDA contracts. Pinterest's ex-COO recently won $22 million in a settlement about gender discrimination. The world is catching onto *environments* and *livability* online, as well as training, but meanwhile, we have to see people like Amber Heard struggle.</p>
<p>From real tests and studies, people will sign petitions, ""join in,"" and more <strong><em>even when they see bots signing</em></strong>. These leaders in tech do not go out and tell them that they're wrong. It's completely enabled, just like as part of the institutions Amber discussed in 2018.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Though Change.org shut down at least 4 abusive comment sections on petitions against Amber, deleted possibly two hate petitions, and the number of 253 in search related to her name has decreased to 241, <em>they still never put reCAPTCHA onto the large hate petition against her</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, you can tell from the ratio of low amounts of comments, likes, and so on compared to 'signatures' that the petitions are usually increased to a set amount to gain attention via machine learning bot experts.</p>
<p>See this short video about the Bots Swarm the days just before Xmas! Happy 'holidays' or should I say, why should coders from reddit hate groups have more of a say than our own leaders?</p>
<p>By the way, it's online retaliation... Let's say maybe the internet differed during #MeToo. If it was different, though studies are as old as 2007, it's now fully controlled by 'men's rights' and other extremist groups. Anyone can hire them, but women in machine learning and AI is rare. In fact, it can just be 17% women in AI according to <a href=""https://action.consumerreports.org/coded_bias"" rel=""nofollow"">Coded Bias</a> documentary.¬†</p>
<p><em><strong>Did you know that it's reported that Women's Shelters in Turkey are No Longer Safe because of (likely mostly online) retaliatory abuse against a Woman, Deniz Bulutsuz, who reported her Male Partner, a charismatic Actor, for violence? Just switch the names with Amber Heard and Depp.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>In reality, anyone who rationalizes abuse against Amber Heard is statistically and scientifically wrong in thinking that they're not harming women's safety and progress by doing so. It's proven in *real life* such as the danger increasing in Turkey due to the rationalized domestic abuse against women that it harms equality.</li>

<p><strong>Enjoy Wonder Woman's release onto HBO Max today - Dec 25!</strong> Have to say it was inspiring and better than the first in 2017. It's directed by a woman, Patty Jenkins, and <em>Diana is frequently shown saving girls and women in the movie</em>.¬†¬†</p>
<p>We hope that 2021 is better for Amber Heard, but it's very challenging due to this wild west technology era. Stay tuned?

There isn‚Äôt any new news about Johnny Depp‚Äôs appeal in the high court of London regarding his libel suit against the Sun tabloid for calling him a Wife-Beater.</p>
<p>And there isn‚Äôt much new that‚Äôs going on in Fairfax county. A few new subpoenas or motions get posted now and again, laying all the groundwork. But nothing too earth-shattering.</p>
<p>Johnny seems to be upbeat, carrying on with the task of being fabulous Johnny Depp. There are whispers of upcoming projects that might include the Addams Family and maybe even Beetlejuice.</p>
<p>Amber Heard has been keeping up the appearance of being an active actress and relevant activist, putting her speaking services on the market. For a mere 30 grand a pop, you can hire Heard to give a motivational speech about surviving hardship, civil liberties, or some such.</p>
<p>Neither one of them seems to be addressing the upcoming defamation court case. Maybe there‚Äôs nothing new to talk about, or maybe they‚Äôre both playing the long game.</p>
<p>Me, I think it‚Äôs the calm before the storm. We still haven‚Äôt seen the majority of the footage from the Eastern Columbia building‚Äôs surveillance system, and we‚Äôre waiting with bated breath for the Toronto tapes. When those hit the public purview, nothing‚Äôs going to be the same.</p>
<p>Why didn‚Äôt we see this evidence in the Sun trial? Because the Sun had nothing to do with the Eastern Columbia building. The Sun had nothing to do with Toronto.</p>
<p>Too many people lost sight of the fact that the Sun trial wasn‚Äôt between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. It was against Johnny Depp and The Sun. Amber Heard was only a witness.</p>
<p>The Fairfax, VA trial is between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. As such, ALL the evidence comes into play. And I sincerely doubt that we‚Äôve even scratched the surface with all the evidence we‚Äôve seen so far. If I were on Johnny Depp‚Äôs legal team, I‚Äôd save the best for last, pulling out the aces when the time‚Äôs right. When it‚Äôs so damning that Amber Heard will have absolutely no defense. When it will well and truly screw her, finally revealing her for who and what she is, what she did, and holding her accountable for it.</p>
<p>We want to see the worst of it so that we can commiserate with Johnny and support him. But we also want him to prevail. We want him to win so that he can clear his good name, once and for all.</p>
<p>Wait for it, folks. Things might be quiet now, but I‚Äôm betting that the very best is yet to come.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,The Calm Before the Storm,StarterPetitionUpdate,28288452.0,2020-12-31 17:35:44+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,"{'id': '225027246', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/2/cj/hy/cqCJhyftbHttrMb-800x450-noPad.jpg?1609436145', 'processing': False}}",,,,against

<p>That post has received over ¬†1,965,562 likes.</p>
<p>On the flip side of the same token, Amber Heard was interviewed by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uretrfMA-Io"" rel=""nofollow"">Access Hollywood</a> in a new video on YouTube talking about how she‚Äôs adapted and survived 2,000, including her legal troubles with Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>That video has received over 283,000 DISlikes.</p>
<p>Likewise, the comments on that video are heavily laden with sentiments supporting Johnny Depp, identifying with him as the victim of Amber Heard‚Äôs abuse. ‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt believe you, because you are a man‚Äù many commenters post, due to an audio in which Amber Heard taunted Johnny saying that people wouldn‚Äôt believe that he was in fact an abuse victim. They call Amber out for portraying herself as the victim when the opposite is in fact true, by her own admission. ‚ÄúI was hitting you,‚Äù She confessed to Johnny on tape.

Justice Nicol, the judge in the case, basically believed Amber Heard‚Äôs claims that she was abused, and found that the Sun, therefore, had every right to call Depp a ‚Äúwife beater‚Äù on their front page.</p>
<p>Since this ruling, many tabloids, which I will not link to here, have run rampant, calling Depp a wife-beater and just about everything else in the book.</p>
<p>Johnny‚Äôs request for a retrial claims that he ‚Äúdid not receive a fair trial‚Äù and the judge‚Äôs ruling is ‚Äúplainly wrong‚Äù and ‚Äúmanifestly unsafe‚Äù, according to documents filed by Mr. Depp‚Äôs legal team with the Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>Says David Sherborne, counsel for Johnny Depp: ‚ÄúThe judge failed to properly assess [Heard‚Äôs] credibility by reference to documentary evidence, photographs, recordings or otherwise.‚Äù He further claimed that audio recordings of Mr Depp and Ms Heard while they were in a relationship demonstrated that ‚ÄúMs Heard had not only been the violent one ‚Ä¶ but that she had also been untruthful in her oral evidence about the appellant‚Äôs violence‚Äù.</p>
<p>You can view the documents Johnny‚Äôs legal team filed on <a href=""https://www.nickwallis.com/courtofappeal"" rel=""nofollow"">Nickwallis.com</a>.</p>
<p>NGN will have to file a response and then a decision will be taken by a Court of Appeal judge on whether or not to allow the application (this can be done with or without a hearing). A decision could come down as early as January. If Depp‚Äôs request for a retrial is dismissed, it‚Äôs all over and Nicol‚Äôs judgment stands.</p>
<p>At that point, Johnny‚Äôs only recourse against his ex-wife (Heard) will be his upcoming defamation suit against her resulting from her op-ed in the Washington Post, in which she describes herself as a survivor of his domestic abuse. She doesn‚Äôt name him specifically in that piece, but she‚Äôs been naming him ever since their split in every other outlet, so her message was clear and obvious.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs hoping the new year brings Johnny the vindication he deserves.</p>

136,https://www.change.org/p/dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,0,0,0,0,,petitions_milestones,,"<p>Up until now, most of the fallout from Johnny Depp‚Äôs legal woes with ex-wife Amber Heard has been at Johnny Depp‚Äôs expense. Now, a lot of folks on the internet are campaigning to see Heard suffer the same treatment. In fact, the petition to remove her from Aquaman 2 is nearing a staggering 2 million signatures. And while WB has yet to announce any plans to hire another actress for the role, it seems that they‚Äôre trying to come up with a compromise.</p>
<p>With all of this going on, it looks like WB is gearing up to either reduce Amber Heard‚Äôs role in Aquaman 2 or write her out altogether.</p>
<p>According to Grace Randolph, the host of the ‚ÄúBeyond The Trailer‚Äù YouTube channel, the studio is bringing on another female lead to ‚Äòbalance things out.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúSome of you are asking re Amber Heard ‚Äì as I told you before, they are bringing on this new female lead to balance things out, and writing the script so that Heard‚Äôs role can be cut down if needed. But as of right now she‚Äôs still in Aquaman 2,‚Äù the journalist wrote on her Twitter feed.¬†</p>
<p>As we learned last month, Warner Bros. may not be able to fire the¬†London Fields¬†star if it comes to it due to her contract. What they can do, however, is find a way to sideline her character in favor of a newcomer in Aquaman 2. To what extent they‚Äôll do so, though, is anyone‚Äôs guess at this point.</p>
<p>Another source has maintained that al of this speculation is pointless, as Amber Heard has already been removed from Aquaman 2. If those sources are to be believed, it‚Äôs true that Amber Heard can‚Äôt be officially fired, but that she‚Äôs been bought out of her contract. Pretty much the same situation as Johnny Depp and Fantastic Beasts. They fired Johnny, but paid his contract. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs rumored happened to heard. They basically paid her not to be in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>Aquaman 2¬†is due to start shooting in Australia after the new year ahead of its scheduled release in December 2022. Time will tell if Heard will be involved. It‚Äôs entirely possible that the new female lead isn‚Äôt just being brought on board to ‚Äúbalance things out.‚Äù She might be Heard‚Äôs replacement.</p>
<p>Good.</p>

137,https://www.change.org/p/dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,0,0,0,0,,petitions_milestones,,"<p>Two years to the day after Amber Heard published an editorial describing the backlash she faced as a domestic abuse survivor, a Virginia judge ordered the actress to produce her arrest record¬†in the defamation case filed against her by ex-husband Johnny Depp.</p>
<p>Her arrest record, which involves an altercation with a different romantic partner more than a decade ago, is ‚Äúcrucial to key allegations in Mr. Depp‚Äôs complaint,‚Äù said the actor‚Äôs lawyer, Benjamin Chew of Brown Rudnick, during a hearing Friday in Fairfax County.¬†</p>
<p>Thing is, though, that I‚Äôm pretty sure there have been more arrests than Heard‚Äôs 2009 arrest for domestic violence against her wife Tasya Van Ree. As I understand it, there have been a couple of DUI‚Äôs and rumor has it that there was at least one other arrest for domestic violence. I don‚Äôt know against whom, but it looks like we‚Äôre going to find out.</p>
<p>If this is true and Amber Has multiple arrests against her for domestic violence, it could be crucial in helping Johnny Depp establish that it was Heard who was violent in their relationship.</p>
<p>On the same day, a subpoena was issued to the ACLU, one of the organizations to which Heard swears she donated part of her 7 million dollar divorce settlement. It ¬†has long been rumored that Heard didn‚Äôt donate to these organizations as she swore in her divorce documents, legal court documents, that she would.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know exactly what could happen to Heard if she kept the money and didn‚Äôt donate it, or didn‚Äôt donate all of it, like she said she would. Contempt of court, maybe? Or would this even be grounds for the divorce to be revisited? Could she owe that money back to Johnny? We‚Äôll have to wait and see what the fallout is, but the fact is that she will now have to prove in a court of law what she did with that money.</p>
<p>If nothing else, it goes to her credibility if she swore to donate that money and didn‚Äôt. Not that her credibility holds much weight anymore.</p>
<p>Three days later, the court issued a subpoena for iO Tillet Wright, longtime friend and flying monkey of Heard‚Äôs. <a href=""https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/circuit/sites/circuit/files/assets/documents/pdf/high-profile/depp%20v%20heard/cl-2019-2911-foreign-subp-prep-io-tillet-wright-12-18-2020.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">The service notice</a> doesn‚Äôt say whether it was Heard‚Äôs side or Johnny‚Äôs that requested the subpoena. It would be interesting to see who called iO. It‚Äôll be even more interesting to see how far iO is willing to go to perjure himself for Heard. It‚Äôs one thing to lie to a court abroad where they can‚Äôt touch you. It‚Äôs another thing to perjure oneself in America where they can easily find you and level perjury charges. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how far any of her friends are willing to perjure themselves.</p>
<p>It bears note that some of those previously pro-Heard folks are deleting their social media en masse. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs related to the defamation case that‚Äôs looming ever larger, but it‚Äôs certainly possible.</p>
<p>By all accounts, it looks like Amber Heard‚Äôs legal world is crashing down on her. I wonder what her response will be when Johnny wins his defamation case, and then wins his appeal in the libel case he leveled against the Sun tabloid and subsequently lost. I wonder what the whole world‚Äôs reaction will be. So many have been so quick to vilify him. I wonder how quick they‚Äôll be to vindicate him.</p>
<p>Time alone will tell.</p>

<p>The agency has even made a statement regarding Amber‚Äôs entry into the agency. On their official website, Amber Heard is described her as ‚ÄúAn outspoken advocate for women‚Äôs rights and for the civil rights of survivors of all gender-based violence around the world, Amber works with organizations that encourage survivors both personally and politically to come forward and reclaim their power. Amber makes frequent trips to DC to lobby and fight on behalf of the civil rights of women and the innumerable silent survivors of gender-based violence.‚Äù<br><br>If you‚Äôd like to hire her to speak at your event, she can be booked for the princely sum of $33,000. The agency describes her talks as ‚Äúdeeply moving‚Äù and says that hiring her is an excellent choice for a group or organization that‚Äôs looking for ‚Äúsome much-needed inspiration from a woman who walks day-to-day looking to be a contribution.‚Äù</p>
<p>There are, of course, those who would vehemently disagree. A large contingency of the public view Heard as a woman who abused her ex-husband Johnny Depp, as she admitted as much on audiotape. Those people find it ludicrous that Heard should dare to claim to be a spokesperson for survivors when she herself is an admitted abuser with a history of being arrested for domestic abuse against wife Tasya Van Ree in 2009.</p>
<p>Heard has already spoken at the Global Citizen Festival, the Social Good Summit and the L‚ÄôOreal Women of Worth awards, leading the reader to believe that Heard was paid to speak at those events. So, with a payday of up to $33,000 per appearance, her outpouring of heartfelt civic duty doesn‚Äôt exactly come across as altogether altruistic, does it? Rather, she seems motivated by the payday, which some would argue has always been her only impetus.</p>
<p>I for one will be interested to see how many people or organizations will hire Heard to speak for such a hefty payday. As more and more evidence comes out about the sort of person she really is, I can only imagine that this prospect will fail for her, just like all the rest of them do.</p>

I‚Äôm one of them. Anything that has Amber Heard in it gets a hard pass from me, and I can think of about 1.7 million people who feel the same way.</p>
<p>Instead, I suggest showing our support for Johnny Depp by watching something by Johnny Depp instead, whether it‚Äôs a DVD you already own, or picking a Johnny Depp movie on the streaming platform of your choice. There are lots of excellent movies to choose from, so it shouldn't be too hard finding a good one. Me, I'll probably be watching Pirates.</p>

140,https://www.change.org/p/dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,0,0,0,0,,petitions_milestones,,"<p>‚ÄúSources say he paid his first wife, Lori Anne Allison, $1.25 million to keep quiet after he allegedly left a long ranting message in which he repeatedly used the N-word. The previously unreported settlement was accomplished using fictitious names to avoid scrutiny.‚Äù</p>
<p>That‚Äôs just one of the many allegations put forth in an article published by The Hollywood Reporter. There are a ton of others, but I won‚Äôt dignify them by repeating them here. I‚Äôll post the link because I have to cite my sources, but I‚Äôm hoping that you won‚Äôt give them any hits by clicking through to read it. It‚Äôs just all the same lies Amber Heard‚Äôs been spouting over the last few years.</p>
<p>I selected this statement to write about because this is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen it. And because it‚Äôs so full of outrageous and flawed elements that I just had to pick it apart.</p>
<p>First, ‚ÄúSources‚Äù? Really? Until or unless these ‚Äúsources‚Äù are identified, it‚Äôs pretty hard to take anything that follows seriously.</p>
<p>Second, it doesn‚Äôt say WHEN this alleged payment took place. Johnny married Lori Anne more than 30 years ago. That‚Äôs a long stretch of road during which this alleged transaction could have taken place. They‚Äôre going to have to narrow it down a little more before it can be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Third, they also don‚Äôt say WHEN this long, ranting message took place. Was it back when they were together? Sometime since? Did he recently call Lori Anne out of the blue just to leave audio evidence of racial epithets nobody else on the planet has ever accused him of using? Just like I said a minute ago, they need to narrow down the timeline.</p>
<p>Fourth, when else has Johnny ever been accused of using language like that? Every? So we‚Äôre supposed to believe that he did it on tape just because some unnamed ‚Äúsources‚Äù say so? Are we really supposed to be that gullible?</p>
<p>Fifth, where‚Äôs this message? If ‚Äúsources‚Äù have heard it, why haven‚Äôt we? Are we supposed to believe that a tape like this exists and it hasn‚Äôt been leaked to the public?</p>
<p>Sixth, why in the world would Johnny Depp need to use a fake name to give his ex-wife some money? If Johnny wanted to give his ex some money, for whatever reason, there‚Äôs no reason whatsoever that he couldn‚Äôt just do so. He gave Vanessa money, too, and there‚Äôs nothing shady about it. By all accounts, he‚Äôs a generous guy. Why shouldn‚Äôt he be able to give his ex some money if he wants to?</p>
<p>I‚Äôm sorry, folks, but it doesn‚Äôt quite wash. They talk about scrutiny, but the fact is that there are far too few details for a claim like this to stand up to even the most casual scrutiny.</p>
<p>The point here, is that headlines like this are juicy and look damning on the surface, but you need to look a little deeper to determine if there‚Äôs any substance to back them up. This is just one among many allegations being tossed about in the press since the court in the UK ruled against him in his libel case against the Sun. The media‚Äôs been having a field day at Johnny‚Äôs expense, and there‚Äôs no more substance to those headlines than there are to this one. It‚Äôs just a bunch of fluffed-up rubbish set forth with no more justification than that someone said so.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt take the headlines seriously, boys and girls, no matter how good ‚Äì or bad ‚Äì they look. There‚Äôs a good chance that it‚Äôs just a bunch of unfounded allegations being printed to sell papers. Or to get clicks online. That‚Äôs all. They, the papers, don‚Äôt care about the truth. If they did, they‚Äôd be exposing Johnny Depp‚Äôs abuser, proven by her own words, rather than serving the victim up on a platter the way they are. So don‚Äôt give them the satisfaction of giving their trash a second glance. Stick to the world of facts which have been proven, tried and true, by the abuser herself.</p>
<p>The truth will out in the end. It‚Äôs no coincidence that this article came out at the same time as Johnny applied to the higher court to move forward with his appeal to overturn the verdict in the Sun case. Like I said before, it‚Äôs all an agenda that‚Äôs being spoon fed to you. Don‚Äôt swallow it.</p>
<p>Keep your wits about you, folks, and keep fighting the good fight. We'll end up on the right side of the roaring rapids in the end.</p>

He posted a picture of himself and Amber Heard with the caption ‚ÄúMe trying not to get beat up every day on set for 3 months.‚Äù</p>
<p>Well, on December 2nd, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1x07aqi1-0&amp;feature=emb_title"" rel=""nofollow"">that video</a> went up on YouTube. Steven and his buddy Jason were chatting away, and then, about 12 minutes in, Steven starts talking about Amber Heard. He described first meeting her as sex personified, and so charming and overpowering that if she‚Äôd told him to go out and kill somebody, he would have done it. Not really, of course, but he was illustrating how much influence she can have on people, even at first sight. At least back then.</p>
<p>He went on to talk about Amber and the fights that she used to get into with her wife Tasya Van Ree, saying that they were real blow up fights. He also hinted at Amber‚Äôs drug and alcohol consumption as activities that he saw with his own two eyes.</p>
<p>Steven also talked about how Amber Heard was when she worked with Johnny Depp on the Rum Diary. Heard wasn‚Äôt even remotely interested in Depp. She was married to Tasya, but was well aware of Johnny‚Äôs interest in her, he said. It wasn‚Äôt until after another couple of movies failed, a tv show failed, then all of a sudden you hear about Amber Heard being with Johnny Depp, and wouldn‚Äôt you know it, she started getting parts.</p>
<p>Amber Heard was with Johnny Depp to further her career. That‚Äôs what Steven said without saying it.</p>
<p>Steven beat around the bush about a LOT of stories he said he could tell, but he was scared to death of getting sued if he told them. Jason assured Steven that the truth is the ultimate defense against a law suit, and that maybe these stories need to be told so that the world has both sides of the situation, not just the one that Heard is telling the world. Still, Steven hesitated and ultimately refused to say any more. The two agreed to talk about this more off-screen and then come back and revisit the issue in a future video.</p>
<p>What strikes me the most about the whole thing is how scared Steven was to talk about events he saw with his own two eyes. And, he said, there are a lot more people with stories to tell that are afraid to talk, too.</p>
<p>Why? Why are these people afraid of her? Because she‚Äôll sue them? Like Jason said, the truth is the best defense against that. And it‚Äôs not just a matter of he say/She say if multiple people are stepping forward to corroborate each other‚Äôs stories. And I‚Äôm sure there are some people with photos or videos to back their stories up. They just have to work up the nerve to step forward and speak up.</p>
<p>All it takes is for one person to say ‚Äúenough‚Äù and stand up. Once that first brave soul makes a stand and speaks out against Amber Heard, I think the floodgates will open up and everybody else who‚Äôs been holding back stories will come forward too. And it‚Äôll be high time. This no-talent would-be actress has held her reign of terror long enough.</p>
<p>And I think that with the VA trial coming up, her web is going to start falling apart. She‚Äôs having to subpoena people who were previously willing to talk about her freely. I think they‚Äôre starting to realize what they‚Äôve got to lose, and that her ship is sinking. And it is. The USS Amber Heard is taking on water, more every day. It‚Äôs only a matter of time until those rats start hopping off. I think we‚Äôre seeing it already.</p>
<p>By all means, go have a look at Steven Crowley‚Äôs <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1x07aqi1-0&amp;feature=emb_title"" rel=""nofollow"">video</a>. See for yourself all of the stories he hints at being able to tell about her, and witness how afraid he is to talk.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs hope he‚Äôs the one that starts the ball rolling about Heard. It‚Äôll make him a hero of epic proportions. He might just by a lynchpin if they get him involved with the VA case.</p>

<p>Among the death threats and social bots online - as tech is a part of this 21st Century story - Waldman refers to homeland security as Depp and Waldman claim Amber created a 'dossier.' In parallels, actress Brittany Murphy and Julia Davis 10 years earlier were targeted and severely monitored for testifying on border control issues of homeland security. Murphy lost her roles in Happy Feet 2 and died suddenly. Amber Heard is targeted to remove her from Aquaman 2 and to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Amber Heard's story beginning to sound like a ""007 Flemming's novel"" to an artificial intelligence auditor? </strong></p>
<p><em>Rose McGowan states Weinstein hired agents who pretended they were journalists and in victim's support groups. They terrified dozens of actresses.</em> Similarly, intense real-time monitoring occurs for Amber Heard online using AI Bots which claim using ""I am"" Persona Dialogue - open source between 2017 and 2020 - to be 'victims' and use ILM/Alex fill in the blank based on previous text Dialogues which goes beyond a 2021 social network analysis paper using BERT: <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9385071"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9385071</a> In irony, Elon Musk's OpenAI GPT-2 and GPT-3 - <a href=""https://github.com/harperreed/gpt3-persona-bot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/harperreed/gpt3-persona-bot</a> - likely is being used against his ex girlfriend, Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Witnesses have been threatened with death, as we were alerted to nearly 2 years ago when an alleged partner of ex-staff claimed Depp's agents wanted to make lies about Amber Heard's trips to Tijuana and targeting her humanitarian work. Their goal is to destroy her, and it was the tip of the iceberg. Depp is cheered and incited by an audience to assassinate President Trump in a clip from his open suggestion.</p>
<p>Then we show how Depp harms Amber Heard with Coercive Control - a level of understanding now understood about domestic violence in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is where Amber won in the NGN trial proving she was a victim of violence in at least 12 out of 14 incidents.</p>
<p>Audio clips, which were cut out of timed leaks, from Incredibly Incredible's channel - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg</a> - are shown to provide context to Coercive Control. From 60 Minutes, a woman in Australia who eventually called the police is told by a corrupt officer that she shouldn't have texted, in writing, about her husband's temper during intoxication that pushes him over the edge as it would trigger an investigation.</p>
<p>In 2016, Amber and IO finally called the police after fearing for her life. Officers went to Depp's 5 Penthouses in Downtown Los Angeles which we show with a pool, numerous rooms, and abusive paintings on the walls which people walk by and ignore. Right next door to this extreme wealth, are the slums of Los Angeles.</p>

Over 30,000 tweets/activities were on January 27th, days¬†<em>before</em> the audio leaks beginning on January 31st in the Daily Mail newspaper and there were few targeted tweets before then in that month. There were over 50,000 on November 2nd, with heightened targeting when it was announced that she won by Judge Nicol in the UK. Ironically, timed with the USA's elections.</li>
<li>Over 9,000 accounts in Natural Language Understanding are seen against her in latest 50,000 tweets with 1,500 supporting accounts in a more specialized monitoring page process.</li>

<li>Recently, we saw two AI Bot accounts threatening Amber Heard with a dead heart profile and raw flesh banner, and Hunting Hound working, then a faceless profile working to boost as well (layered persona bots). If you recall, the trials in 2020 revealed that Depp put raw meat around the house and in Amber's gown. How does a moderator-type person who is 'not a bystander' sleep? It's like a smoking gun that we used to ask a Twitter Worker - finally reached after all of this time - for help, who said our studies were forwarded.</li>
<li>On April 2nd, they said a proactive bot would be used to monitor for only 1 week.

<p><strong>Remember Amber Heard's extensive evidence despite manipulation via social media online</strong>¬†... (so much, that we all recently saw the deadly attack at the Washington DC Capitol, which was incited and organized online)....<br>According to someone with NATO clearance, since at least April/March of 2020 it's been known about hostile entities using bots on Twitter and elsewhere to try to cause a USA Civil War... and people continue to walk right into it. The Virginia ruling to dismiss Amber's cyberabuse sections of her counter lawsuit is another sign of USA weaknesses against hate and objectification online that's causing in-person violence. It's tragic.</p>
<p>How does this affect Amber Heard? She's caught in the middle of this era and is a Cyber Civil Rights Spokesperson. SHEILD Act still has not passed.</p>
<p>We're continuing to take down hate pages, such as one on Reddit, and we reported the continuous hate bots, even to an AI Lead of Google (who recognized spam as harmful, but not abuse of saying 'she's not a victim') and a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) worker there.</p>
<p>When will social impact matter more for future generations?</p>
<p><strong>JANUARY 05, 2021 by¬†Eriq Gardner - Amber's Countersuit goes forward, but misses the online part of social manipulation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Johnny Depp Must Face Ex's Libel Suit After His Attorney Declared ""Hoax""</strong></p>
<p>A Virginia judge allows Amber Heard to partially proceed on counterclaims, although not the one that targeted her ex-husband for allegedly deploying bots against her.<br>Johnny Depp has failed to leverage a new law that he may be partially credited for bringing about. On Monday, a Virginia state court judge rejected the actor's bid for immunity over statements made about Depp's ex-wife Amber Heard. As a result, if the case moves to trial later this year, Depp will face counterclaims after his attorney told media outlets that Heard's tale of domestic abuse was a ""hoax.""...</p>
<p>Heard alleges that her former husband has deployed social media bots against her in alleged violation of Virginia's Computer Crimes Act. She says he's directed a concerted effort to tarnish her career and interfere with endorsements and acting gigs as retaliation for what she has publicly claimed about their troubled marriage. As for Heard's story of being abused, after Depp attorney Adam Waldman told media outlets that it was ""fake"" and all part of a ""sexual violence hoax,"" Heard included defamation counterclaims too...</p>
<p>Now comes White's first big decision on those counterclaims ‚Äî a ruling that represents the most significant legal development since¬†a U.K. judge rejected Depp's lawsuit¬†against a British tabloid. <strong>The November ruling that¬†Heard's tale of being physically assaulted was ""substantially true""</strong> has¬†wounded Depp's career...</p>
<p>The judge rules that Heard hasn't sufficiently alleged the elements of a computer crime, in particular communication of obscene language.</p>
<p>But Depp will continue to face her $100 million claim over statements made by Waldman to the¬†Daily Mail¬†in 2020. (Prior statements are deemed outside the statute of limitations.)...</p>
<p>""In support of her accusation of malice, Ms. Heard alleged that the¬†GQ¬†journalist, Mr. Heath, stated that Mr. Depp invited him to interview the actor because he was 'angry ‚Äîangry about a lot of things ‚Äîand he's vengeful,'"" states the opinion. ""Moreover, Ms. Heard has alleged that Mr. Depp has the intention of ruining her career; citing statements that he made to friends demonstrating a malicious intent. Further, Mr. Depp has admitted his intent to destroy Ms. Heard's career by stating that he wanted her replaced on¬†Aquaman.¬†Accordingly, Ms. Heard has sufficiently pled a malicious intent, which prevents a ruling on the self-defense privilege at this stage in the litigation.""<br><br>From: <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/johnny-depp-must-face-exs-libel-suit-after-his-attorney-declared-hoax"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/johnny-depp-must-face-exs-libel-suit-after-his-attorney-declared-hoax</a></p>

Amber and I were supposed to go bowling the night before, but Amber told me that she could not join because she had been in a bad fight with Johnny. I came over to the Eastern Building to apply makeup before her TV appearance, and as I walked into her kitchen, I saw writing on the countertop in gold marker.

<p><strong>Photos, audios, texts, witnesses, and data proved Amber Heard is a victim of domestic abuse.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amber is a spokesperson for the ACLU, Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, World Identity Network, and United Nations Gender Equality SDG5.</strong></p>
<p>Heard continues to make frequent trips to DC to lobby and fight on behalf of the civil rights of women and the innumerable silent survivors of gender-based violence that were attempting to make their voices heard during that pivotal moment in US history. In October 2018, she visited the United Nations in Geneva, where she addressed diplomats about women‚Äôs rights and gender-based violence. Most recently Amber presented the UN Sexual Violence Survivors Rights Resolution at the General Assembly to International diplomats and ambassadors along side RISE (A Non Profit that has successfully passed civil rights bills in 38 states domestically). Amber has continued with trips to Central America where she met with human-rights defenders, diplomats, and indigenous community leaders.</p>
<p><em>She has spoken for, introduced and advocated for democratic candidate Kamala Harris since 2007 and has been very active in supporting Harris in her 2020 presidential run</em>. Most recently, Amber has introduced and advocated for federal legislation to criminalize consensual pornography (known as ‚Äúrevenge porn‚Äù) through bi-partisan congressional support with Representative Jackie Speir, Congressman John Katko, and Kamala Harris. Her actions have been crucial to the creation and passing of the SHIELD Act, which is the legislation she is fighting to pass in DC, in her capacity as the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative Ambassador.</p>
<p>An eloquent and passionate speaker, Amber has lent her voice to major global events like the UN Social Good Summit, Global Citizen Festival, One Young World Conference and the Incredible Women Gala... She has participated in global forums for young people, women, and the scientific community. Not only has Amber spoken to a global audience, but also she has addressed at the Create and Cultivate conference in New York and the Giffoni Film Foundation Festival &amp; Conference in Italy and spoke at the UN for the UN WE Day in New York. Most recently Heard was honored by the Hetrick Martin Institute in NY and given the Emery Award. Heard was honored by ACLU in 2017 with the Humanitarian of the Year award.</p>
<p>Recently, Amber spoke with Richard Dawkins and the Center for Inquiry in a symposium on scientific inquiry and free-thought in the increasingly polarized political world at Arizona State University for thousands of people attending.</p>

<p>On the night of the blowout fight, a friend of Heard, who asked to remain anonymous had dialed 911, claiming that the actress was being ‚Äòassaulted‚Äô by her boyfriend.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHi, I need to report an assault right now happening at 849 Broadway at the Eastern building, it‚Äôs penthouse three,‚Äù the female caller says in the recording, referring to the luxurious home the former couple previously shared in downtown LA.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI happen to know that it‚Äôs happening and I just need to remain anonymous,‚Äù she added.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo what did she say that this guy assaulted her or hit her?‚Äù the LAPD operator replies, explaining she needs more detail.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPhysically assaulting her, yeah,‚Äù replies the caller ‚ÄùSend somebody up there please,‚Äù the caller pleads, reiterating the location of the couple‚Äôs penthouse before the call abruptly ends.</p>
<p>Another 911 call was made by Heard‚Äôs friend iO Tillet Wright.</p>
<p>That means that two sets of officers responded to the scene. And both sets of officers have insisted from day one that they saw no evidence of violence, not on Heard‚Äôs face, and not in the condo.</p>
<p>Up until now, it‚Äôs been a matter of he say/she say, leaving judges, journalists, and the public to decide who to believe.</p>
<p>But now, the debate is over. In bodycam footage from the second set of officers, the condo is clearly seen as being tidy and undamaged. You can read the article from the Daily Mail <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9474979/Johnny-Depp-says-police-bodycam-footage-PROVES-Amber-Heard-lying.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>And you can see a clear version of the bodycam footage <a href=""https://twitter.com/DigitalDDaniels/status/1383126221458915332"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>Depp‚Äôs attorney Adam Wadman says the footage proves that there was never any wrecking spree and that Heard‚Äôs account of the evening cannot be believed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAmber Heard and her friends described a chaotic, messy crime scene but the newly released LAPD bodycam videos unambiguously show that the penthouse was utterly undamaged and that their testimony was one more grandiose lie,‚Äù Waldman told DailyMail.com in a statement.</p>
<p>Depp and Heard will square off in April, 2022 in a defamation suit that Depp filed against his ex-wife. It remains to be seen how this new footage will affect the proceedings, but it doesn‚Äôt look good for Heard.</p>
<p>It also remains to be seen if this new evidence will inspire perjury charges in previously offered court testimony in Depp‚Äôs recent libel suit against NGN and the Sun tabloid in the UK. That‚Äôs where Heard described the chaotic scene.</p>
<p>Heard is currently being investigated for perjury charges in Australia for testimony surrounding an incident in which Heard smuggled the couple‚Äôs dogs into Australia in violation of quarantine laws.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs possible that these mounting legal woes will affect Heard‚Äôs appearance in any upcoming projects, and could potentially land her jail time. Time will tell the extent to which this new evidence, and Depp‚Äôs impending slander suit will affect Amber Heard.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will Heard shrug this evidence off? Or is this the mic drop moment for Depp in his quest to vindicate himself?</p>

Unlike Atlantis, its placement is unstable, meaning the location of the city constantly changes, never to be found in the same place twice. Apparently. So, while the working title could just be a fun nod to lore, it could also mean Arthur may interact, or even fight, Mongo. It‚Äôs safe to say that Black Manta will return as Aquaman‚Äôs nemesis.</p>
<p>Jason Momoa will return as the titular character, and despite fans‚Äô protestations, Amber Heard is still clutching the notion that she will once again be the queen of the deep. However, there‚Äôs also been constant speculation that a¬†new major female character is being written into the script, as a means to both increase diversity among the ensemble and reduce Heard‚Äôs screen time in the event of a worst case scenario. WB has yet to confirm that, but insider Daniel Richtman is now claiming that¬†Aquaman 2¬†will have four female leads, though the tipster doesn‚Äôt offer any further details to elaborate on his intel.</p>
<p>Heard‚Äôs Mera, the aforementioned mystery character and Nicole Kidman‚Äôs returning Queen Atlanna will presumably make up 75% of the quartet, leaving one position unfilled. But with filming set to start a mere two months away, we should start to get some answers soon, both about the new mystery character and Heard‚Äôs dubious chances of returning as the film‚Äôs primary female lead.</p>
<p>Aquaman 2¬†is currently set for a December 16, 2022 release.</p>

It‚Äôs an interesting reaction, considering she already won the UK lawsuit, but apparently Amber Heard has simply had enough of the Internet backlash.</p>
<p>Adam Waldman called Amber out in a tweet pointing out that despite claims of being brutalized by Johnny Depp, Amber Heard appears days later in a photo shoot, without any sign of injury.¬†</p>
<p>Heard's backlash was to call Waldman short. Such witty repartee.¬†</p>
<p>It‚Äôs worth mentioning that Adam Waldman is actually Johnny Depp‚Äôs lawyer, and that he‚Äôs been using social media as a way to call Amber Heard and her claims into question. This includes much of the majority of his Twitter feed, but it was the particular image posted above that caught Amber Heard‚Äôs attention. It seemed she had enough of Adam Waldman, and decided to respond to him and a variety of Johnny Depp fans on Twitter as a result.</p>
<p>Most recently, Depp supporters have been targeted, having their comments reported en masse in an attempt to have them banned from Twitter. The Depp supporters remain, however, and don't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon.¬†</p>

<p>Depp and Heard have to wait a full year before Depp's Defamation case against Heard gets to court. In that time, I'm sure we'll see a lot of action back and forth between Heard and her ex-husband. And, from the look of it, we can expect to see even more hostilities between Heard, her posse on Twitter, and Johnny Depp supporters.</p>

<p>Rubbish. I'd like to use a stronger word, but refrain.</p>
<p>As much as this is a blow to Johnny Depp, it's more of a defeat for male victims of domestic violence, particularly in the UK. This kind of finding tells them that, no. they won't be believed, so just shut up and take it, and don't you dare speak up. It shouldn't be that way. I must change.</p>
<p>The thing to remember at this point is that this verdict is not a win for Amber Heard. This case wasn't against her. It was against NGN and the Sun.</p>
<p>What we can do now is look forward to the Defamation trial in VA. That one is directly between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. I'm a little nervous about that one because Heard never named Depp in her WaPo OpEd, the reason he finally sued her. On that basis alone, it could very well go her way, even though it's obvious who she was talking about.¬†</p>
<p>But no matter how it goes, the truth about Heard will come out. There's evidence we haven't even seen yet. No matter how court goes, she loses in the court of public opinion, which will directly impact upon her career. Let's remember that she doesn't have any active projects coming up while Johnny Depp and his production company is directly involved with no fewer than 20 projects coming up.¬†</p>
<p>This decision today is beyond ridiculous but it's one battle, not the war. Let's try to stay positive and look forward to the Virginia trial. It's a different court, a different case, and is more than likely to come out a different way.¬†</p>

235,https://www.change.org/p/dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,0,0,0,0,,petitions_milestones,,"<p>According to <a href=""https://www.distractify.com/p/is-amber-heard-going-to-jail"" rel=""nofollow"">Distractify</a>, Amber Heard could be facing up to three years of jail time if the court rules in Johnny Depp‚Äôs favor.</p>
<p>Amber Heard could be going to jail if Johnny Depp wins his lawsuit.<br>Basically,¬†Amber Heard¬†claimed on the stand in Johnny‚Äôs libel suit against the Sun tabloid that Johnny Depp had physically and emotionally abused her.</p>
<p>Back in 2015, Heard showed up in court with a black eye seeking a restraining order.¬†Johnny claims that Amber had faked her black eye seen at the court, and¬†Amber Heard‚Äôs stylist¬†corroborated this. She stated, ‚ÄúThroughout the day of December 16, 2015, I could see clearly that Amber Heard did not have any visible marks, bruises, cuts, or injuries to her face or any other part of her body.‚Äù</p>
<p>Since then, Johnny Depp has fought back against every bad word against him with libel and defamation lawsuits, so far against¬†The Sun¬†(which he lost), and against Amber Heard, which has not yet been seen in court. According to¬†Deadline, the latest update is that their court date is once again pushed back to at least April 11, 2022.¬†If Amber Heard loses, she could face jail¬†time for tampering with evidence.</p>
<p>Even though it‚Äôs possible Johnny Depp could win his upcoming lawsuit in the coming years, there‚Äôs no confirming whether or not Amber Heard will face jail time. Regardless, this puts Warner Bros. in a tough spot. Even though fans had petitioned for Warner Bros. to force¬†Amber Heard‚Äôs resignation from¬†Aquaman 2, WB hasn‚Äôt announced any plans for change.</p>
<p>However, in December 2020, a lifestyle article in¬†Forbes¬†about Emilia Clarke‚Äôs home let the cat out of the bag that Emilia Clarke had signed on to replace Amber Heard as Mera in¬†Aquaman 2.¬†Sadly, though, there‚Äôs still no confirmation. It could just be wishful thinking on the fans‚Äô part.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not clear according to that article why Amber Heard could be facing jail time if Johnny Depp wins his appeal. They mention tampering with evidence, but don‚Äôt say clearly what evidence, or how it was tampered with.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and suggest that if Johnny wins his appeal, Heard might be on the hook for some very serious perjury charges. She‚Äôs already being investigated in Australia for Perjury charges for falsifying statements about smuggling their dogs Pistol and Boo into the country. So it wouldn‚Äôt be a far stretch if she‚Äôs investigated in a London court for the same crime. Not for lying about the dogs, this time, though, but for potentially lying on the stand during Johnny‚Äôs libel case against NGN and the Sun tabloid.</p>
<p>It could be for something else altogether.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs not forget that there‚Äôs no statute of limitations in Australia for grievous bodily injury requiring medical attention. And that‚Äôs where Heard cut off the tip of Johnny‚Äôs finger with a Vodka bottle. And, no. I‚Äôm not making a wild accusation there. Heard herself was recorded on audiotape admitting that she did, saying ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to do it!‚Äù and begging Johnny not to leave her.</p>
<p>The point being, if Johnny wanted to, he could always file a report with Australian police and have her put behind bars for a long time. And if her were the vengeful monster she keeps trying to say he is, he would have done that already.</p>
<p>All Johnny‚Äôs interested in is clearing his name. He‚Äôs said it time and time again, and the fact that Heard‚Äôs not cooling her heels already in an Australian prison proves it.</p>
<p>What do you think? Will Heard face jail time if Johnny wins his appeal? Or if he wins his defamation suit? Should Johnny press charges in Australia over his severed finger?</p>
<p>Yeah. I do too.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,Amber Heard facing jail time?,StarterPetitionUpdate,28633362.0,2021-03-01 18:23:47+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,"{'id': '225270885', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/1/yp/om/ahyPoMgOnXIvGwP-800x450-noPad.jpg?1614623031', 'processing': False}}",,,,against

<p>This petition has reported long since that Heard‚Äôs contract has been bought out by WB and that she won‚Äôt appear in Aquaman 2. But the masses want proof, rightfully so. Well, the more time goes by, the more it looks like we might actually have been properly informed.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs being reported lately that Emilia Clarke might have signed on to replace Amber Heard in Aquaman 2. But, again, there‚Äôs no confirmation, though an article in Forbes seems to be as legit a source as it gets. So we can‚Äôt be sure about that part of the speculation about Amber Heard‚Äôs dubious future in AM2.</p>
<p>However‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Recently, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf2AgE2eE8M"" rel=""nofollow"">Popcorned Planet</a>‚Äôs Andy Signore went on record saying: ‚ÄúThe part of this story that is true is that, yes, Amber Heard is fired from Aquaman 2. Now, from what I‚Äôve heard so far she‚Äôs been fired from Aquaman 2. From what I‚Äôve heard through a source, though other people that are involved in the production is that it already happened.‚Äù</p>
<p>Previously, we‚Äôve heard that WB bought out Heard‚Äôs contract because she might not be bondable (due to alcohol and drug use, perhaps?). If she can‚Äôt be insured for the duration of filming, she can‚Äôt film.</p>
<p>But the reason might be something completely different than what we thought.</p>
<p>According to <a href=""https://www.sausageroll.com.au/entertainment/movies/amber-heard-aquaman-2-contract-terminated-for-health-fitness-reasons/"" rel=""nofollow"">Sausage Roll</a>, Amber Heard might not appear in AM2 because she ‚Äòs not physically fit enough. They say: ‚ÄúAmber Heard did not pass her physical examination. She‚Äôs put on some pounds and is in terrible shape. There is a clause in her contract which says she is required to be in good form ahead of shooting and she violated that.‚Äù</p>
<p>True to form, Heard manages to blame Johnny Depp for it, throwing Covid in for good measure. ‚ÄúHeard allegedly blamed Johnny Depp and COVID-19 for her deteriorating health, saying that she‚Äôs been under tremendous amount of stress and has been suffering from depression but she insists that she will get back in shape.‚Äù</p>
<p>Filming for Aquaman 2 is set to start filming in June (2021), so it remains to be seen whether or not she‚Äôll get back in shape. We‚Äôll also have to wait and see if she is, or becomes, bondable for filming.</p>
<p>That seems like a lot to happen in just a few months.</p>
<p>Also, according to another industry insider, Heard may have failed to report an injury. If she were injured, failed to report it and got further injured during training, which is quite rigorous, the studio would have been on the hook for it. So, it's entirely possible that this is the nature of Heard being physically unfit.</p>
<p>Whichever the reason it seems more likely than not that the rumors about Amber Heard not appearing in AM2 are true. I don‚Äôt know whether it will Emelia Clarke or not that takes over, but I‚Äôm totally on board with it if it is.</p>

237,https://www.change.org/p/dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,0,0,0,0,,petitions_milestones,,"<p>The latest story coming from leaker Daniel Richtman is saying that <a href=""https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/johnny-depp-reportedly-furious-amber-heard-job-offers/"" rel=""nofollow"">Johnny Depp is furious</a> that his ex-wife Amber Heard‚Äôs star appears to be rising as his falls. According to Richtman Depp is ‚Äúpissed‚Äù that she keeps getting work.</p>
<p>Heard recently appeared in CBS‚Äô¬†The Stand¬†and is about to film¬†Aquaman 2¬†despite¬†multiple <a href=""https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/petition-amber-heard-fired-aquaman-2-closing-2m-signatures/"" rel=""nofollow"">fan campaigns</a> trying to get her fired¬†(Mera will also play a minor role in¬†Zack Snyder‚Äôs Justice League¬†next month, a movie that‚Äôs already been filmed).</p>
<p>But it‚Äôs the latest rumor doing the rounds that must seriously enrage Depp, as reports say that Heard is¬†in contention to portray <a href=""https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/amber-heard-reportedly-play-liveaction-rapunzel-disney/"" rel=""nofollow"">Rapunzel</a>¬†in Disney‚Äôs live-action version of¬†Tangled.</p>
<p>The actress potentially being hired by the House of Mouse for a big role just as they drop Depp from his most iconic part (Captain Jack Sparrow, of Disney‚Äôs Pirates of the Caribbean franchise) must really stick in his craw.</p>
<p>But this story isn‚Äôt over yet, as Depp is mounting an appeal to the verdict in his failed libel suit against NGN media and the Sun tabloid, and there are lawsuits filed in Virginia that could go more favorably for him.</p>
<p>Still, According to Richtman, right now, Heard is going from strength-to-strength and¬†Johnny Depp¬†is suffering major career damage. So even if he‚Äôs eventually vindicated, he might never again be the A-lister he once was.</p>
<p>Where to start.</p>
<p>First, the sober truth is that Heard is a little long in the tooth to portray a Disney princess. Those girls are usually in their mid-teens, and Heard is twice that age now. It‚Äôs highly unlikely that she‚Äôs up for any such part.</p>
<p>Second, after Heard has pestered Disney with subpoenas and legal shenanigans, it‚Äôs not likely at all that they would line up to sign her for anything, let alone a role half her age.</p>
<p>Third, Johnny is not hurting for work. If you look at Depp‚Äôs <a href=""https://pro.imdb.com/name/nm0000136?rf=cons_nm_meter&amp;ref_=cons_nm_meter"" rel=""nofollow"">IMDB pro</a> page, he‚Äôs lined up to be involved with more than twenty projects.</p>
<p>Heard has <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1720028/"" rel=""nofollow"">2 projects</a> on her books. Aquaman 2, which she probably won‚Äôt appear in. Strong rumor has it that Emilia Clark will replace Heard in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>The other project is ‚ÄúRun away with me‚Äù a project which was abandoned years ago. Two movies she will most likely not even appear in. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all she‚Äôs got scheduled for future projects.</p>
<p>Finally, but not least, it‚Äôs looking more and more like Johnny Depp is going to be vindicated in both court proceedings, leaving him in a much more favorable position than Heard.</p>
<p>So it‚Äôs not quite as bleak for Depp as Richtman would have you believe. Either his information is faulty or he‚Äôs just plain wrong.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is Heard‚Äôs star rising? Or is Depp coming out on top?</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,Johnny Depp pissed off?,StarterPetitionUpdate,28613653.0,2021-02-25 21:01:42+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,"{'id': '225257223', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/8/pj/sq/bdpJsQhkPxDtqNI-800x450-noPad.jpg?1614286904', 'processing': False}}",,,,against

But, probably due to Covid, the trial date has been pushed back to April 11th, 2022.</p>
<p>Now, it's possible that Johnny will get word back about his appeal to overturn the verdict in his libel suit against NGN and The Sun tabloid before he even sets foot in the courtroom for his defamation suit against Heard. He might be vindicated on the British front first.</p>
<p>Heard has been worried in the past about how the defamation suit will affect her filming schedule. But if she's found to have lied in a British court, and if Australia has their way about her lying in one of their courts, her filming schedule might be the last thing she'll have to worry about.¬†</p>
<p>Instead, the courts might have to figure out how to het her from jail to the courtroom. That could make for some interesting travel plans.</p>
<p>Somehow, I doubt that the flight they'd put her on would have Champaign and caviar.¬†¬†</p>

<p><a href=""https://insidethemagic.net/2021/02/amber-heard-tangled-ad1/"" rel=""nofollow"">One article</a> says that she's negotiating to play princess Rapunzel in Tangled. <a href=""https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/ent/amber-heard-disney-princess.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Another one</a> backs it up.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure how seriously to take these revelations.¬†</p>
<p>First, there's the messy legal battle that's warring between Amber Heard and her ex-husband Johnny Depp. It's a sordid affair, and Heard has dragged Disney into it by demanding a plethora of documents from them, pretty much any dealing they ever had with Johnny Depp, his schedule, his contracts, his alleged drug use or bad behavior on the set, anything she can get her hands on.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just me, but I don't think that Disney would be too quick to negotiate with somebody who's causing them so many legal woes.</p>
<p>And second, there's the demographic of Disney princesses. Traditionally, Disney princesses are in their mid-teens, just coming into their own. Amber Heard is 34 years old, and not getting any younger. That's just about twice the age of the average Disney princess.¬†</p>
<p>I suppose it's not impossible that Heard could be in talks with Disney to portray a princess, but I think it's highly unlikely.</p>
<p>A lot of frivolous press has been floating around about Heard lately, but I personally think that this is among the more amusing.¬†</p>
<p>What do you think? Would Amber Heard personify a Disney princess? Or has the time for kind of role come and long gone for her?</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,Amber Heard a Disney Princess?,StarterPetitionUpdate,28560793.0,2021-02-16 19:45:28+00:00,,dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,"{'id': '225220517', 'petitionMedium': {'url': '//assets.change.org/photos/8/lw/xn/KIlwxNJYTqhbTMN-800x450-noPad.jpg?1613504731', 'processing': False}}",,,,against
240,https://www.change.org/p/dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,0,0,0,0,,petitions_milestones,,"<p>Often when putting together a franchise, the powers that be offer the principal players a three picture deal. That cuts down on scheduling conflicts and keeps actors from negotiating for a better deal in-between each picture. But that‚Äôs not always the case. Just as often, they take it one film at a time.</p>
<p>In the case of the Aquaman franchise, it looks like they opted to do one film at a time. If that is indeed the case, no actor is guaranteed a part in the second or third installment.</p>
<p>According to insider Daniel Richtman, Amber Heard is already scrambling to try to secure her place in Aquaman 3, even though AM2 hasn‚Äôt even begun to film yet.</p>
<p>There are doubts about whether or not Heard will even appear in AM2. Almost 2 million people have made it clear that they don‚Äôt want to see Amber Heard in any further AM films, and it‚Äôs possible that WB is paying attention. One rumor has it that Heard‚Äôs screen time in AM2 is being severely curtailed, with another female lead taking on more screen time.</p>
<p>Other rumors whisper that Heard‚Äôs contract has been bought out, meaning that while Heard got paid, she will not appear in the film at all.</p>
<p>There are several factors that will likely determine whether Heard comes back in any subsequent Aquaman films. First, there are the court cases going back and forth between Heard and her ex-husband, Johnny Depp. Depp is suing Heard for Defamation for portraying him as a domestic abuser who physically abused and terrorized her throughout their marriage. Depp is having none of that is on a legal crusade to clear his good name and prove that it was Heard who was the abuser the entire time. Heard has a lot of sob storied and the support of her friends to back up her abuse storied, while Depp has video and audio recordings of her admitting to abusing him. Unlike Heard, Depp also has medical evidence, including a fingertip that got severed and a burn on his cheek from a cigarette being put out on his face.</p>
<p>The two are also embroiled in litigation in England from a libel case that Depp leveled against NGN media and the Sun tabloid, for calling Depp a wife-beater. Initially, the judgement favored the Sun, who repeated that wife-beater claim again. But Depp is appealing the verdict, and will likely prevail.</p>
<p>If these two cases go Depp‚Äôs way, it doesn‚Äôt bode well for Heard‚Äôs continued presence in the AM franchise. Most films have a morals clause in their contracts, and if Heard is proven to be a domestic abuser again, that clause might very well be invoked.</p>
<p>I say ‚Äúagain‚Äù because Heard was arrested in 2009 for domestic abuse against her then wife Tasya Van Ree.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs also the issue of whether or not Heard is bondable. That is to say, whether or not she can be insured for the duration of filming. If she can‚Äôt be insured for any reason, like a preexisting medical condition, excessive drug or alcohol abuse, she can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt be hired for any future AM project.</p>
<p>Heard supporters insist that she‚Äôll be in AM2 and 3 because there hasn‚Äôt been any official announcement from WB about her being dropped. But that‚Äôs not the way it works. If Heard has been dropped, there likely won‚Äôt be any announcement. The movie will simply come out without her in it. So fans who want her dropped who are waiting for an announcement won‚Äôt get one. We‚Äôll just have to wait for the film to come out to see whether she‚Äôs in it or not.</p>
<p>Time will have to tell whether or not Amber Heard is in Aquaman 2, let alone Aquaman 3. We‚Äôll have to wait and see how those court cases come out, and whether or not Heard is bondable. As ever, I‚Äôll bring you the latest as I find it.</p>

241,https://www.change.org/p/dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,0,0,0,0,,petitions_milestones,,"<p>Amber Heard is a nobody, at least according to Amber Heard. In one of her latest court filings, Amber has a fit about people calling her that.</p>
<p>If you recall, Heard filed in her original $100 million dollar counterclaim to Johnny Depp‚Äôs $50 million dollar defamation suit against her, that there was an army of bots under Depp‚Äôs command torturing her. Even creating and/or signing this very petition. An investigation found less than a dozen questionable Twitter accounts that might be bots, blowing that claim out of the water.</p>
<p>Undaunted, Heard has shoved forward, trying to obtain personal data about 200 Twitter users, to prove that they‚Äôre bots and not real people, I guess.</p>
<p>Now, she‚Äôs down to two. TWO people that she‚Äôs upset at for: 1) saying they‚Äôre proud of Johnny Depp for fighting to clear his name, and 2) refer to the defendant (Heard), a movie star, as ‚Äúa nobody.‚Äù And she had to put that in there, that she‚Äôs ‚Äúa movie star.‚Äù She needed to point that out, I suppose, in case anybody forgets that she got lucky off the back of being married to Johnny Depp and scored Aquaman. Would she have gotten that movie on her own? Anybody? Bueller?</p>
<p>She‚Äôs throwing everything she can at the wall with regards to Twitter users, hoping that something will stick.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all of the statements she‚Äôs throwing around by Twitter fans are protected opinions of celebrities. People just don‚Äôt like her, and there‚Äôs not one single thing she can do about it.</p>
<p>What I suspect, however, is that she doesn‚Äôt really expect any of this Twitter bluster to stick to the wall. I think it‚Äôs a diversionary tactic, intended to direct attention away from the avalanche of evidence Johnny Depp has that‚Äôs bearing down on her.</p>
<p>And it works. For a minute. But she‚Äôs deluding only herself if she thinks that the people who support Johnny Depp are about to lose sight of the big picture. They might point fingers and laugh at her folly when she tries some new antic, but they‚Äôre steadfast to the case at the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>What will she pull next? What new filing will she throw at the court to try to filibuster her way out of the inevitable? We‚Äôll have to wait and see. One thing that‚Äôs sure is that it‚Äôll bring out more finger pointing and giggles, at least until the final verdicts come down. Then it will be Johnny Depp that gets the last laugh.</p>

You know, the one where Heard claimed that Depp struck her in the face with a phone.</p>
<p>iO has been very vocal in his support of Heard, claiming to bear witness to the after-effects of many violent episodes where Heard said that Depp brutalized her. Blood on a pillow, hair on the floor, that sort of thing. Mind you, iO never witnessed any violence, just saw that (staged?) scene afterwards.</p>
<p>Now, iO is trying to quash the subpoena calling for him to appear for a deposition.</p>
<p>In his motion to quash, iO says: ‚ÄúI am not a party to the above-referenced actions. I have personal knowledge of the matters set forth herein, and if called upon to testify thereto, I could and would completely do so.‚Äù</p>
<p>But‚Ä¶</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have never been served with any subpoena in this action (Case No. 19stcp04763) or in the Virginia Fairfax County Court Action (Case no. CL-2019-0002911). Rather, I understand that Mr. Depp‚Äôs lawyers emailed copies of the subpoena to my lawyer, Lee Brenner, on January 20, 2021.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI do not reside at the address of 6144 Panorama Street, Joshua Tree, CA 92252, and I have never resided at that address. I have no ownership interest in that address.‚Äù</p>
<p>I understand that a man named Anthony was at the address that day, and I have spoken to him. He said that he spoke to a process server that day (Jan 19, 2021) who left a pile of papers on the front step.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI declare under penalty of perjury and under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúExecuted this 8th day of February 2021, and Joshua Tree, California.‚Äù</p>
<p>And he signed it.</p>
<p>Further: ‚ÄúHere, Mr. Wright was not served with the subpoena at issue. See Wright Cecl. At ¬∂ 3-5. First, he does not reside at the address listed on the Subpoena nor does he have any ownership interest in that address. Id., at ¬∂3, Mr. Wright has spoken with a man named Anthony who was at the address listed on the ‚Äúproof of service‚Äù on January 19 2021 and was told that a process server left a pile of papers on the front step. Id., at ¬∂5. Mr. Wright does not know why anyone would say that they served him because they simply did not. Id., at ¬∂ 4. In the light of the foregoing, the subpoenas are procedurally defective and should be quashed.</p>
<p>Okay, then.</p>
<p>First, if iO has no ownership or interest in that address, how does he know who was there on that day or any other? He clearly knows more than he's letting on, to have spoken with a man he says was there that day.</p>
<p>Look, I don‚Äôt care one way or another where iO lives, but this just doesn‚Äôt add up.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs iO so scared of that he‚Äôs trying to dodge his subpoena? Is he afraid that the hoax is finally going to catch up with him and that he could face charges of perjury if he lies to an American court? Fines can be hefty, and jail isn‚Äôt exactly kind to trans persons.</p>
<p>Maybe the time has come for iO to reconsider his position in the Amber Heard fiasco. Because, dodge as he might, that subpoena is going to catch up to him, like it or not.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbz-aaNo56U"" rel=""nofollow"">the video</a>, a nameless, faceless person uses a Russian website to create over 2,000 signatures.</p>
<p>According to the video‚Äôs creator, for over 16 hours his bot signed the petition over 2,000 times. It can do 3,000 a day from ONE bot channel and infinitely more from multiple channels.</p>
<p>The fact that the bots in this case are being made to look Russian in origin plays right into Amber Heard's narrative that all or most of the signatures on the petition are fake. And it's important that they're of Russian origin, since great measures were taken to try to tie them to Adam Waldman, Johnny Depp's lawyer and friend.</p>
<p>According to this article: ""The bot‚Äôs Russian origin is a crucial aspect of this story.¬†Adam Waldman,¬†Johnny Depp‚Äôs¬†attorney who was¬†barred from his upcoming libel case¬†in the United States, is a former lobbyist for Russian oligarch¬†Oleg Deripaska,¬†a Russian billionaire, and Kremlin insider. It‚Äôs believed by some¬†he was involved with or has insider knowledge, of the 2016 hacking of the US election.""</p>
<p>Laying it on really thick in the anti-Waldman crusade.</p>
<p>In recent history, two things have apparently bothered Amber Heard: Adam Waldman and this petition. She took care of Waldman by successfully lobbying to get him removed from Johnny Depp's upcoming Fairfax defamation case against Amber Heard. That backfired, though, since removing Waldman from the case left him free to discuss the case freely. And he has been. Check out <a href=""https://twitter.com/adam_waldman"" rel=""nofollow"">Waldman's Twitter</a> feed to read some delightful insights into the case.</p>
<p>And it's obvious that the petition bothers Heard, who mentions it prominently in her $100 million dollar countersuit.</p>
<p>It's not the first time action has been taken to try and get the petition removed. Not long ago, negative comments were posted on the petition, and then reported as violations to try to get the petition taken down.</p>
<p>That didn't work, and this isn't going to, either. I've already been in contact with Change.org, and rest assured. The petition is quite safe.</p>
<p>Johnny Depp has a hearing on 18 March regarding his appeal in the UK libel case against the Sun, and the defamation suit in Fairfax is due to start in May - if it's not pushed back due to Covid.</p>
<p>With these cases looming so large, it's possible that more shenanigans will pop up trying to further discredit Adam Waldman and attack the petition. Hopefully, both of these cases will reach fruition soon, and the matter can be decided, once and for all.¬†</p>
<p>How do you think these cases will play out? Will Johnny Depp get justice? Or will Amber Heard prevail?</p>

However, there are reports making the rounds that a new female lead is being introduced as well,¬†one that could potentially reduce Heard‚Äôs screen time¬†in the finished product depending on how her next court case opposite ex-husband Johnny Depp plays out.</p>
<p>On that note, insider Daniel Richtman is now claiming that the actress is furious after catching wind of the decision, and isn‚Äôt happy with Warner Bros. trying to essentially force her out of the spotlight as the female lead of the highest-grossing DC Comics adaptation in history.¬†</p>
<p>We might take this report with a grain of salt, though, considering insiders in the industry have been saying for months that Heard won't be in Aquaman 2 at all.¬†</p>
<p>Sources say that WB has bought out Heard's contract completely. That means that she'll be compensated for her contract without actually appearing in the film.¬†</p>
<p>This flies in the face of some media claims that she's going to get a raise or that <a href=""https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/amber-heard-join-team-zack-snyders-justice-league/"" rel=""nofollow"">Mera will take over</a> for the titular Arthur Curry in the Justice League movies. I guess we'll just have to wait and see who's right.</p>

<p>Johnny Depp and his legal team immediately appealed the decision.</p>
<p>The appeals process has been rather involved, first going to the original judge to approve or deny that the appeal should move forward, which the judge denied. It was his judgement, after all. That was to be expected.</p>
<p>That left team Depp open to take the appeal to the next level, further requesting that the judge's denial should be overlooked and that the appeal should move forward.</p>
<p>That process could have left Depp and his crew in legal limbo for a year or more. But now, Depp's lawyers have asked for permission to introduce new evidence. That's ramped up the process, and there's going to be a hearing on the evidence, and the appeal at large.</p>
<p>The hearing is set for March 18th.¬†</p>

She‚Äôs tying herself to Wood, including them together in her claims railing against men she seems to allege are getting away with abusing women, calling out the media, saying: ‚Äú...and yet, no one sees the trend here? Everyone wants to tag a bathroom wall, no one wants to understand the writing. Evan &amp; I aren‚Äôt the 1st to raise our hands. Are you done ignoring it?‚Äù</p>
<p>It seems that Heard went on a bender last night, posting about how the media seems to be ignoring Marilyn Manson after Wood‚Äôs allegations.</p>
<p>What it‚Äôs got to do with her, one has to wonder. There are some Johnny Depp fans that really don‚Äôt want to see Johnny dragged through the mud in the Manson case, but it seems that Heard is desperate to make sure that he is, by association.</p>
<p>In her meltdown, at one point, Heard goes off on somebody that calls her a fraud, telling them to shut up if they haven‚Äôt been in a situation where they were being strangled and fighting for their life. And, true to fashion, she did it using the tweenspeak trend of using numbers to abbreviate words, making it that much harder to take her accusations and vitriol seriously.</p>
<p>Is she now saying that she herself has been strangled? Are these new allegations she‚Äôs coming up with against Johnny Depp, or did she at one point say that he was strangling her while he was brutalizing her. Is that part of the testimony she gave behind closed doors? Or was that ‚Äújust‚Äù about being brutally raped? Is there anything she won‚Äôt come up with to throw at Johnny Depp to try and make her case stick?</p>
<p>In another post, she continues her rage against rich white men, which some might say is rather ironic since those have been the type of men she‚Äôs spent her intimate time with. Or, perhaps she‚Äôs just talking about the ones that have rejected her.</p>
<p>If you recall, Heard‚Äôs former assistant Kate James revealed that Heard stole her story of being raped. Is she now appropriating Wood‚Äôs story about being strangled?</p>

They're taken out of order, from different posts and different conversations, but they are her own words, so enjoy.¬†</p>
<p>Heard amusingly refer to Johnny Depp fans as Wald-Mignons - referring to Depp's lawyer and friend Adam Waldman. I'm pretty sure she meant minions, but fell flat with the intended slight. One fan responded that Mignon actually means cute or pretty, ""...so, thanks.""</p>
<p>It seems that Heard is desperate at this point, especially with Depp‚Äôs appeal in the UK case looming so near in the future. We all thought we‚Äôd have to wait up to two years to hear anything else about that, but here it is, with a huge milestone in the case happening just next month.</p>
<p>Yes, she seems desperate. And with what could be a huge victory for Depp looming large on the very near horizon, it stands to reason that we'll likely see more from Heard, whether it's in the context of her own case or not.¬†</p>

<p>There‚Äôs some speculation among netizens as to what that evidence could be.

It was those charitable donations that caused Justice Nicol to decide that Heard was not a ‚Äúgold digger.‚Äù If it can be proven that she didn‚Äôt donate the money, Nicol‚Äôs finding in that regard can definitely be challenged, and could affect whether or not Depp can continue with his appeal process.</p>

250,https://www.change.org/p/dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,0,0,0,0,,petitions_milestones,,"<p>Evan Rachel wood has been talking for a couple of years about having been allegedly horribly abused by an ex. She spoke before panels and worked hard to try to reform domestic abuse laws.</p>
<p>Today, she came forward with the name of her <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/02/01/marilyn-manson-accused-horrifically-abusing-evan-rachel-wood/4335539001/#:~:text=Manson%2C%20in%20a%202009%20Q%26A,told%20the%20outlet%20of%20Wood."" rel=""nofollow"">alleged abuser: Marilyn Manson</a>. The two got together when Wood was in her teens and MM was in his thirties.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who immediately believe Wood because of her history of talking about this alleged abuse, and because Manson is just so weird. Also because he wrote in his autobiography that he used to be an abusive piece of shit and that he used to imagine crushing her skull with a sledgehammer. And for saying that the song ‚ÄúI Want to Kill You Like They Do in The Movies‚Äù was inspired by one of their breakups.</p>
<p>On top of that, four other women have stepped forward with similar accusations of their own against MM.</p>
<p>All of that, along with Wood‚Äôs disturbing allegations have a lot of people willing to crucify MM on the nearest telephone pole.</p>
<p>What does that have to do with Amber Heard or Aquaman 2? At first glance, nothing. But if we take a closer look, the associations abound.</p>
<p>First, ERW is ‚Äúclose‚Äù friends with Heard. Wood has come out in <a href=""https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/english/hollywood/news/Evan-Rachel-Wood-defends-Amber-Heard-amid-her-feud-with-Johnny-Depp/articleshow/53280392.cms"" rel=""nofollow"">support of Heard</a>‚Äôs allegations against Johnny Depp since Heard first started to allege them ‚Äì which is just about the time that Wood started talking about being a victim of domestic abuse. Coincidence number one.</p>
<p>Also, it‚Äôs a pretty well-known fact that MM is (or was) best of buddies with Johnny Depp. The two of them haven‚Äôt been seen together in about a year, but they have a long history of being besties. Whether or not that‚Äôs still the case isn‚Äôt really known.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also a fact that as far as I know, none of the women accusing MM ever called the police or filed any reports. The only word we have is in the media and on social media. I‚Äôm not saying that makes them liars, far from it. A lot of victims never report their abuse. Johnny Depp didn‚Äôt call the police. He relied upon his own private security to protect him.</p>
<p>All I‚Äôm saying is that the allegations against MM are pretty severe, with women saying they‚Äôve been violently raped, had their lives threatened, were locked in closets, were beaten, even whipped, and more. With allegations so severe, it‚Äôs easy to wonder why the police weren‚Äôt called, at least by one of them. It would certainly make the allegations easier to swallow.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm also not saying MM didn‚Äôt do it. His own words in his autobiography don‚Äôt bode well for him, certainly.</p>
<p>What I‚Äôm saying is that we need to wait and see some proof, one way or the other. Until that happens, all we have is a she-say/he-say situation.</p>
<p>It could come down in a number of ways. MM could be the heartless, sadistic monster his self-proclaimed victims say he is, and he should be locked up for life.</p>
<p>Or it could come down that the girls are in cahoots. Wood and Heard, I mean. The two of them, friends, have been alleging abuse against MM and Johnny Depp for roughly the same amount of time, and now would be a great time to come forward with MM‚Äôs name, what with the legalities between Heard and Johnny Depp shaping up the way they are. It‚Äôs not looking too good for Heard in the Fairfax, VA defamation case Johnny has leveled against her. So what better time to cut the legs out from under Johnny‚Äôs bff with allegations of even more monstrous abuse?</p>
<p>Or the two cases could have nothing whatsoever to do with each other but coincidence.</p>
<p>Right now, it‚Äôs too soon to call.</p>
<p>One thing that is a fact is that Amber Heard has made it more difficult for victims of either gender to come forward with their stories of abuse thanks to her lies about being abused. Her sh*tstorm of mainstream media stories and crusade through the #MeToo movement have made it nigh impossible for anybody to come forward without enduring intense scrutiny. Gone are the days when we could #BelieveAllWomen. Heard‚Äôs completely ruined that.</p>
<p>So yeah. While there is a faction ready to believe her outright, ERW is being looked at with some skepticism by a large contingency.</p>
<p>The only real truth here is that time will have to tell the truth of what‚Äôs going on. My suggestion is to neither believe nor deny these allegations against MM until there‚Äôs some shred of proof to back them up, or to prove that they‚Äôre false.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs what happened with Johnny Depp. He was accused of domestic abuse and a lot of people believed it. Then proof came out that those allegations were false.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying we should do here. Wait for some proof. Reserve judgement until we know definitively, one way or the other. The truth always outs, and it will in this case, too.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at that, shall we?</p>
<p>Jason Momoa's total net worth is reported to be $14 million, and that's combined with his wife, former Cosby kid Lisa Bonet's net worth. It's not impossible that Momoa was paid a figure in the millions, but it's not likely.¬†</p>
<p>Let's take a look at some examples for comparison.</p>
<p>Robert Downey Jr, a talented and well-respected actor was reportedly paid $500 thousand for Iron Man.¬†</p>
<p>Gal Gadot was reportedly paid $300 thousand for Wonder Woman.</p>
<p>These two were the stars of their movies. And we're supposed to believe that Amber Heard was paid $7 million for a supporting role? It's not impossible, I suppose. But I suspect that pigs would sooner fly.</p>
<p>The same magazine clip claims that Heard will probably make closer to $10 million for her part in Aquaman 2.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at that, too.</p>
<p>Sources have confirmed that Amber Heard will not be in Aquaman 2. She hasn't been fired, exactly. Word has it that she was never re-hired. Being bondable is one concern. Morals clause infringements might very well be another.</p>
<p>Rather, her contract has reportedly been bought out by WB. So, while she might have been paid for the project, she will likely not appear in it.</p>

<p>Remember when Johnny Depp wanted to make arrangements for the trial to allow for his filming of FB? Heard successfully argued against it, refusing to let the court make any such allowances for him. That might, in part, have been why Johnny Depp was asked to step down from the franchise. His filming schedule would have been interrupted - partly by that three-day deposition she made him sit for that conflicted with filming.</p>
<p>Well, now the shoe is on the other foot.</p>
<p>Because of court's Covid-related scheduling conflicts, the case may very well be pushed back into what she claims will be HER filming schedule. And, since she already argued against scheduling court around filming for him, the same applies to her.¬†</p>
<p>If .court couldn't be rescheduled for him, it can't be rescheduled for her.</p>
<p>Sauce for the gander is just as good for the goose.</p>
<p>There's also the small matter of fact that filming for Aquaman 2 will take place in Australia, where Heard is being investigated for perjury in relation to smuggling her dogs into Australia.¬†</p>
<p>Given both of these circumstances, and the fact that reliable sources report that her contract has been bought out, chances are very slim (see what I did there?) that Heard will appear in Aquaman 2.</p>

<p>That's why Johnny's case is so important. Not just to clear his own name, but to clear a path for abused men to be able to come forward as victims and be believed.</p>

<p>This picture also flies in the face of Heard's testimony that Johnny didn't let her wear anything too revealing when they were together.</p>
<p>Funny how those lies add up, innit?</p>

<p>There's a subpoena issued for ""an executive"" from Disney, seeking: ‚Äúall information relating to documents and communications of any nature‚Äù on Depp and ‚Äúincidents of drug or alcohol use (including suspected drug or alcohol use).‚Äù Similarly, they are looking for any information about ‚Äúany delays or tardiness caused by Mr. Depp,‚Äù ‚Äúany incidents of violence or abuse by Mr. Depp,‚Äù any info on impute the actor had or ‚Äúhiring, casting,‚Äù and ‚Äúdisagreements with the writers, directors or producers with the filming, editing and/or release of Pirates 5.‚Äù</p>
<p>There's a subpoena out for the LAPD as well, wanting: everything that the police have on file regarding a May altercation between Heard and Depp that led to Heard receiving a restraining order against Depp. And they mean everything. Any correspondence, body cam footage, everything.¬†</p>
<p>Heard insists that the final altercation between herself and Johnny Depp was Depp's fault because he was physically and verbally abusing her. Johnny insists that the altercation never happened, that it's a hoax perpetrated by Heard and her close circle of friends.</p>
<p>If body cam footage of the police's response exists, it could go a long way toward proving one position or the other.¬†</p>
<p>The court date is looming ever nearer. We'll have to wait and see how this one goes. If you remember Johnny lost a libel suit against the Sun because the judge said he believed Heard.¬†</p>
<p>That case is under appeal, so we'll have to see how that one turns out, too. It's not over for Johnny in either case. Not by a long shot. He is determined to clear his name, and there is an army of fans worldwide that support him wholeheartedly.¬†</p>

260,https://www.change.org/p/dc-entertainment-remove-amber-heard-from-aquaman-2,0,0,0,0,,petitions_milestones,,"<p>As part of her divorce settlement, Amber Heard pledged to donate her entire 7 million dollar settlement to charity. Namely, to the American Civil Liberties Union and the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Heard has said in numerous interviews in the last several years that the money was donated, split between those two charities. She also testified to it under oath, under penalty of Perjury.</p>
<p>Well, lately, things have gotten really interesting. Turns out the only contribution that‚Äôs been made to the Children‚Äôs hospital was the original $100,000 Johnny Depp made on her behalf. And there‚Äôs no proof of what, if anything, Amber Heard donated to the ACLU herself. Apparently there have been donations made on her behalf, but no proof that she, herself, donated a single red cent.</p>
<p>For one thing, it was part of a legally binding contract (her divorce), that she would donate that money. For another thing, she testified under penalty of perjury that she donated it.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the penalty for Perjury in the UK is up to 7 years in prison. Pile that on top of perjury charges she‚Äôs being investigated for in Australia, and those years are really starting to pile up on her.</p>
<p>In a truly amusing turn of events, Amber Heard, through her lawyer, is now claiming that she can‚Äôt make those donations because of Johnny‚Äôs ongoing litigation.</p>
<p>""However, Amber has been delayed in that goal because Mr. Depp filed a lawsuit against her, and consequently, she has been forced to spend millions of dollars defending Mr. Depp's false accusations against her.""</p>
<p>And never mind that Heard was supposed to have made those donations 3 years before he ever filed suit against her.</p>
<p>Heard plans to fulfill those donations ‚Äúeventually,‚Äù her lawyer says.</p>
<p>So, basically, Heard‚Äôs defense against being accused of not paying 7 million dollars to charity is to admit that she didn‚Äôt pay 7 million dollars to charity, and blame it on Johnny.</p>
<p>Keep on digging, Amber. Keep on digging.</p>

<p>The court in Fairfax, VA has issued an <a href=""https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/circuit/sites/circuit/files/assets/documents/pdf/opinions/cl-2019-2911-depp-v-heard-01-24-21.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Opinion Letter</a> dismissing most of Amber Heard‚Äôs counterclaim, and upholding only a few bits of it. But the parts where she mentions this petition say that:</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe allegations that ‚ÄúMr. Depp has initiated, coordinated, overseen and/or supported and amplified two change.org petitions: one to remove Ms. Heard as an actress in the Aquaman movie franchise, and one to remove her as a¬† spokeswoman for L‚ÄôOreal‚Äù fails under the second prong of the VCCA. See Countercl. Paragraph 6. Nothing in that allegation implies facts showing that the change.org petitions included obscene language, threatened illegal or immoral acts, or suggest or propose obscene acts. See Va. Code 18.2-152.7:1. Likewise, the allegation that Mr. Depp ‚Äúcreated, coordinated, controlled, and/or manipulated social media accounts created specifically for the purpose of targeting Ms. Heard,‚Äù also fails under the second prong of the VCCA. See VA code 18.2-152.7:1. The pleading fails to demonstrate that the social media accounts communicated obscene language, suggested obscene acts, or threatened illegal or immoral acts. Because neither of those allegations meet the second element of the VCCA, they cannot move forward in this litigation.‚Äù</p>
<p>So the court didn‚Äôt buy all that nonsense about Johnny Depp¬† being responsible for these petition and all us ‚ÄúRussian bots.‚Äù So even the court recognizes how ridiculous that claim was.</p>
<p>The only bummer about it is that now, I probably won‚Äôt be called to testify that Johnny Depp had nothing to do with the creation or maintenance of this petition. I was kind of looking forward to that.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to the letter, addressing more about Heard's counterclaim, but that's the part that deals with this petition.</p>

He will bear the scar from that for the rest of his life.¬†</p>
<p>Also, Amber Heard was arrested in 2009 for abusing a former domestic partner, Tasya Van Ree, demonstrating a repeated pattern of abuse by Amber Heard.</p>
<p>Since Heard's divorce from Johnny Depp, she has systematically crusaded to ruin Depp in Hollywood, repeating multiple accounts of fake incidents in which she had actually abused Johnny Depp, but lied and created false accounts of him being the abuser. About the incident during which she shattered the bones in Johnny Depp's finger and nearly severed it, causing Depp to require surgery to reattach and repair it, Heard presented a false story claiming that he cut off his finger himself, dipped it in paint and scrawled obscenities all over the walls.¬†</p>
<p>Likewise, Heard recounts fabricated incidents of Johnny Depp hitting her in the face when she had, in fact, punched him. Though staff and neighbors in the building where she lived reported seeing no marks on her face in the hours and days after she says Johnny Depp hit her, yet she appeared in court six (6) days later with bruises on her face, asking for a temporary restraining order, which was granted. Photos of Heard from the very next day show her full face, without makeup, and not a single bruise.</p>
<p>As Amber Heard is a known and proven domestic abuser, Walt Disney Animation Studios and Walt Disney Sudiosshould and must not consider Heard for their Tangled film project. They must not ignore the suffering of Heard's victims, and must not glamorize a domestic abuser.</p>

<p><strong>Update: Jamell Demons aka @YNWMelly‚Äôs co-defendant Cortlen Henry aka @YNWBortlen was granted bond and house arrest. Melly remains in jail until trial. The victim‚Äôs family understands the release but does not agree with it. They hope for full justice and safety of all witnesses.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jamell Demons, also known as rapper YNW Melly, is requesting to be released from the Broward County Jail for medical reasons after¬†testing positive for coronavirus.</strong><br><strong>The 20-year-old Vero Beach native is¬†accused of killing two of his longtime friends,¬†21-year-old Anthony Williams and 19-year-old Christopher Thomas Jr., in Miramar in 2018. Prosecutors are¬†seeking the death penalty¬†if he‚Äôs found guilty.</strong><br><strong>But John M. Phillips, the lawyer representing the family of Thomas Jr., says the family doesn't want YNW Melly to be released.</strong><br><strong>""It is preposterous they seek to release him to a ‚Äúfan‚Äù and that defense counsel put that fan‚Äôs name, address, phone number and information in the public domain,"" he said. ""We again ask the public to be sensitive of the victims here. They lost children.""</strong></p>
<p><strong>Four men who grew up in the Vero Beach area are at the center of a story about two rappers who are accused of murdering their friends. It's a complicated story that includes a police claim of a staged drive-by shooting, and a¬†wildly popular artist who recently released a¬†song with Kanye West.And now one of the¬†men involved is¬†facing the¬†death penalty¬†if convicted. Here's what we know:¬†</strong></p>
<p><strong>October 2018</strong><br><strong>Christopher Thomas Jr., 19, of Gifford, and Anthony Williams, 21, of Fort Pierce¬†were¬†shot and killed Oct. 26 in South Florida, according to the Miramar Police Department.Both were driven to Memorial Hospital Miramar about 4:35 a.m., and arrived with multiple gunshot wounds, but, police said, were already dead.Thomas went by the stage name YNW Juvy, while Williams was known as¬†YNW Sakchaser.The men were last seen alive in Fort Lauderdale about 3:20 a.m. that same day, police said.The identity of the friend who drove Williams and Thomas to the hospital was not released at that time.¬†The two were part of a group of friends that included¬†Jamell Demons, aka YNW Melly, and¬†Cortlen Henry, aka YNW Bortlen.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arrests made</strong><br><strong>¬†Miramar Police¬†</strong><br><strong>‚úî@MiramarPD</strong><br><strong>¬†(1/2) Jamell Demons, a.k.a. YNW Melly &amp; Cortlen Henry have been arrested and charged with two counts of first degree murder. The victims, Anthony Williams &amp; Christopher Thomas Jr., were killed on 10/26/2018. The investigation, supported by forensic evidence, has concluded that.Miramar police said an investigation concluded that Demons shot and killed Williams and Thomas.¬†Henry¬†was arrested in Texas and extradited to Broward County on Feb. 12.Demons¬†turned himself in to¬†officials in Broward County on Feb. 13.Both were charged with two counts of first-degree murder. Henry also was charged with two counts of accessory after the fact.Miramar police said Demons and Henry plotted to kill the young men they grew up with, then staged their bodies to look as if a drive-by shooting had occurred.Demons is accused of firing the shots,¬†court records show. Henry then drove to the hospital¬†with the bodies in a Jeep SUV, according to police.Prior to turning himself in, Demons posted a photo on Instagram of all four young men together, proclaiming his innocence.""A¬†couple months ago I lost my two brothers by violence and now the system want (sic) to find justice,"" Demons said in the post.¬†""Unfortunately a lot of rumors and lies are being said but no worries god is with me and my brother (Henry).""</strong></p>

<p><strong>New details emerge</strong><br><strong>Court documents obtained March 1¬†detail how Miramar police said the rapper staged the deaths of two friends.About 4:35 a.m. Oct. 26, Henry pulled into¬†Memorial Hospital Miramar with the bodies of Williams and Thomas in the passenger seats of a bullet-riddled Jeep Compass.He originally told police the two were killed by unknown assailants in a drive-by shooting,¬†but police later said Henry and Demons had orchestrated the killings, with Demons pulling the trigger and Henry assisting a¬†cover-up.Arrest records filed with the Broward County court Feb. 14 detail a variety of evidence supporting the allegations. Among the investigators' claims:Police found no evidence of shots¬†fired in the location Henry said the shooting occurred.¬†There were no reports of gunshots in the area.Cell phone records and surveillance video showed an¬†associate had given¬†false information about Demons' whereabouts before the shooting.</strong><br><strong>Cell phone records and surveillance video showed the path taken to the hospital contradicted Henry's testimony.</strong><br><strong>Forensic evidence at the actual crime scene, determined by cell phone records and K-9 search, showed no other vehicles were present at the time of the shooting.A trajectory analysis on the vehicle showed the paths of the bullets (right to left) did not match the victims' wounds (left to right).</strong><br><strong>Also detailed was evidence investigators said directly implicated Demons as the shooter:A shell casing from a .40 caliber handgun that matched casings found at the crime scene was discovered on the floorboard of the left rear passenger seat in the vehicle, where video evidence showed Demons had been sitting.</strong><br><strong>Evidence from an autopsy also showed the shot that killed Williams, who had been sitting in the front right passenger seat, had come from behind and to the left and was fired¬†from less than three feet away.</strong><br><strong>Investigators said evidence showed Henry and Demons had¬†driven around for a period of time with the two dead victims in the vehicle ""prior to entering the hospital"" in ""a calculated effort to establish their version of the incident(.)""</strong><br><strong>The motive for the shooting was not known as of March 4.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Not guilty plea</strong><br><strong>Demons¬†pleaded not guilty March 5 to charges of first-degree murder.¬†The case is slated to be heard in front of a jury.¬†A hearing is scheduled for April 25.Henry is expected to be arraigned March 11 on two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of accessory after the fact.Neither man had an attorney listed in court records the morning of March 6.Update:¬†Henry,¬†who ""stood mute"" as the charges were announced,¬†entered a plea of not guilty¬†March 11 in a Fort Lauderdale courtroom,¬†according to Paula McMahon, spokeswoman for the¬†Broward County State Attorney‚Äôs Office.Update:¬†State prosecutors filed notice in April of their intent to¬†seek the death penalty in the double murder case.¬†By state law, first-degree murder is punishable either by death or life without parole for suspects at least 18 years old at the time of the offense.According to the Legal Information Institute at Cornell University, which¬†is appropriate in a given case is¬†decided on the basis of so-called¬†""aggravating factors"" which, in the jury's estimation, increase the severity of or culpability of a crime.In the April 18 court filing, prosecutors stated their intent to prove a number of aggravating factors, arguing the killings were:""especially heinous, atrocious or cruel""</strong><br><strong>""committed in a cold, calculated and premeditated manner without any pretense of moral or legal justification""</strong><br><strong>""committed by a criminal gang member""</strong><br><strong>Update:¬†Demons' attorney, Bradford Cohen, of Fort Lauderdale,¬†filed a motion May 30¬†to grant bond with the Broward County court.Cohen said Demons did not pose a flight risk, arguing¬†if he wanted to flee¬†he would have done so on learning of the outstanding warrants after a concert¬†in Washington D.C. Instead, Cohen said, Demons flew to Florida and surrendered himself to authorities. Cohen emphasized the rapper has ties to Gifford.More:¬†¬†Attorney says rapper 'not a flight risk,' points to Gifford family ties</strong></p>
<p><strong>Criminal history</strong><br><strong>Vero Beach police arrested Demons in late 2015 when police said¬†he¬†fired a gun¬†at a group of people during a dispute near Vero Beach High School, where the then-16-year-old was a freshman.</strong><br><strong>At 17, Henry¬†was charged with fleeing from deputies who attempted a traffic stop near the Indian River Mall. He was tackled after hopping out of his vehicle and¬†fleeing on foot, July 2016 arrest records show.</strong><br><strong>In January 2017, Demons was arrested on weapons charges after a traffic stop. Deputies reported finding a loaded 9 mm pistol with a laser attachment beneath Demons' feet and a .40-caliber Glock with an extended magazine in the glove compartment.</strong><br><strong>State troopers arrested Demons, Henry and Williams in June 2018 after finding three Glock handguns and large containers filled with¬†marijuana¬†in an SUV south of Fort Myers.</strong><br><strong>In January, Demons¬†pleaded no contest to possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia¬†and was given a 25-day jail sentence.</strong><br><strong>Musical success</strong><br><strong>Demons, who announced he was signed to¬†Young Thug's record label, YSL Records, in September,¬†is seen as a rising star in the Florida rap scene.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He has more than a million social media followers, and his most famous song,¬†""Murder on my Mind,""¬†has more than 88¬†million views on YouTube. The track was certified gold by the¬†Recording Industry Association of America.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† He released¬†a¬†song with Kanye West¬†in January that has 17 million views on YouTube. Henry posted a video of himself and Demons¬†recording with West on social media.Both songs were charting on¬†Billboard's Hot 100¬†in the weeks leading up to his¬†arrest.Demons'¬†""Murder on my Mind"" was released in 2017,¬†but its lyrics and the video's disturbing imagery have come under increased scrutiny¬†since Demons' arrest and accusations he killed Thomas and Williams.The weekend after his arrest, ""Murder on my Mind"" reached No. 1 on the U.S. Apple Music chart, according to Chart Data, a Twitter account that tracks music metrics.¬†Meanwhile, the song has steadily been climbing the¬†Spotify¬†charts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The documentary</strong><br><strong>A YNW Melly¬†documentary released in December¬†gives an intimate look at the rapper's¬†Gifford upbringing¬†and¬†what seemed like a tight knit friendship with the other three artists also from the Treasure Coast.""We ain't never had no fear. You can't hang around us if you got fear,"" Demons said in the 20-minute film. ""Cause we know what we doing, you know what I'm saying? And that's why we so tight.""Demons' mom said she got pregnant¬†at 14 and gave birth in ninth grade.""Gifford, it can make you or break you,""¬†she¬†said, clearly proud of her son's newfound success.</strong></p>

<p>My name is Lorraine Mitchell.¬†</p>
<p><br>My stalking ordeal began back in the summer of 2007.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of stalking cases. The man who stalked me for 10 years was a stranger to me. Until he first approached me outside my work , I had never seen him before. I had no idea his name or where he lived. However he knew everything about me. <br>He stopped me just as i got into my car and asked me out on a date. When¬† I refused, he kept insisting and when i was about to drive off, he disclosed that he had been following me for 2 years ..he knew my name, my address, the names of my 3 children, he knew i had been divorced a year and that i was seeing someone.</p>
<p><br>For the next 10 years, I lived in fear of my life from this man who would not leave me alone. He would follow me in his car, stop me on my dog walks,¬† send me inappropriate messages on social media , even when i blocked him he would set up a new profile.. differant name but same photograph. Every time i rejected him, my car tyres got let down, my car was moved, my beloved cat was killed , and then later dug up and was decapitated.¬† He he even followed me in his car to the police station when i went to ask for help! When he was brought in for questioning,¬† and released he was told to stay away from me. But he continued to stalk me, and then also much to my despair started to follow my daughter.¬†</p>
<p>Even though i reported him to the police, the police did not take me seriously until¬† July 2017. Finally in August he was arrested and charged with stalking under section 4a ( fear of violence). He was sentanced by Judge Paul Tain to 4 years in prison.Judge Tain said it was one of the 'worst cases of its kind.'</p>
<p>¬†The last 2 years , I have felt safe,¬† but have flown by and the man who stalked me will be released into the public this August. Only a couple of weeks away. I have been told by the probation department that I am not allowed to know the day of his release, until the day he is released.¬† On the day of his release I will be phoned by the probation and it I will be informed that he has been released into the public. I will also then be told of only the conditions of his release, which apply specifically to me. I have been informed by the probation office that it is not their policy to inform victims of the exact date of their perpetrators release from prison in order to protect the perpetrator!</p>
<p>This¬†means every day in August,¬† I will wake up thinking, "" Is this the day he will be released?"" I cannot plan holidays in August now, as I do not want to leave my adult son at home, incase the stalker turns up. Stalking is about power and control, and once again this man has control over me. I feel that victims needs should be taken into consideration when perpetrators are released. Especially victims of stalkers. Why are his needs so more important than mine?¬†</p>
<p>Once I know what date he is going to be released I can then prepare myself. In the past he has repeatedly broken restraining orders carrying weapons. I believe he still poses a significant risk to me, my family and my pets. I have realised also, that I am not alone in this horrendous situation.¬† All victims of crime are not allowed to know the date of their perpetrators release. As Stalking is about obsession, fixation and is relentless¬† and no treatment has been found to cure this,¬† I am petitioning that all victims of stalking and domestic abuse are given the date of their perpetrators release into the public. This is so that victims can prepare themselves and keep themselves safe.</p>
<p>I have since received an apology from Sussex Police and have been ask to speak at Police training days on stalking. However on hearing other victims stories,¬† I feel changes are needed which could prevent lives been lost and damaged.¬† Stalking is about Power and Control. Victims have their lives totally controlled by these awful perpetrators. Please help me to have our voices heard and I would be so grateful if you would sign my heartfelt petition.¬† Thank you.¬†</p>

Let‚Äôs Get educated about wolves and stop killing such a majestic animal. People are hunting and killing them for sport. This is cruel and humane. Wolves are peaceful non confrontational animals! Here are some facts.</p>
<p>Myth: Wolves are mean and vicious animals.</p>
<p>‚ó¶ Truth: Wolves are gentle animals, that are instinctively terrified of humans.</p>
<p>Seeing a wolf in the wild is an extremely rare sight. This is because they‚Äôve learned to fear humans since we‚Äôve hunted and killed them for so long. They can smell us from up to five miles away and take off running. They are flighters, not fighters. If you somehow end up in a situation where you are face to face with a wolf, they will do anything they can to scare you off (growling, snarling, etc.) so that they can run away. Myth: Wolves are a menace and need to be hunted to protect our livestock and ourselves.</p>
<p>Truth: Wolves contribute so much to the environment and rarely bother people or livestock <br>As I mentioned above, wolves are naturally scared of humans and will do whatever they can to avoid us. They are not a danger to people. In fact, there are no verified documented cases of healthy wolves attacking people. Most attacks are done by coyotes, coywolves, or wolfdogs.<br>Wolves prefer leaner meats, that means elk and deer. They don‚Äôt like beef. The only times they ever hunt cows are when the alpha has been killed (usually by a trophy hunter), and the pack has not been properly taught how or what to hunt, so they go for the easier kills. Wolves do not hunt for fun. They only hunt for food when they need it. They take down their prey and drag it back to the den. They won‚Äôt take a bite and then leave it behind.<br>I‚Äôm sure all of you have heard or seen what wolves have done to Yellowstone. Wolves were absent until a few years ago when they were reintroduced. The environment in Yellowstone drastically improved. Wolves are keystone species. We need them. Please don‚Äôt hunt them.<br>Myth: Wolves have blue eyes.</p>
<p>Truth: Wolves eyes range from amber to dark orange to golden brown.</p>
<p>Pure wolves don‚Äôt have blue eyes. However, wolfdogs do (usually husky/wolf mixes). If you see a movie with a ‚Äúwolf‚Äù that has blue eyes, it‚Äôs either a wolfdog or CGI. Growling is used as a warning. A wolf may growl at intruding wolves or predators, or to indicate dominance.<br>Barking is used as a warning. A mother may bark to her pups because she senses danger, or a bark or bark-howl may be used to show aggression in defense of the pack or territory.</p>
<p>Howling is the one form of communication used by wolves that is intended for long distance. A defensive howl is used to keep the pack together and strangers away, to stand their ground and protect young pups who cannot yet travel from danger, and protect kill sites. A social howl is used to locate one another, rally together and possibly just for fun.<br>Wolves convey much with their bodies. If they are angry, they may stick their ears straight up and bare their teeth. A wolf who is suspicious pulls its ears back and squints. Wolves spark intense emotions. They are revered as symbols of wildness, worshipped as the spirits of nature, idolized as the ultimate social animals. Yet fear and hatred of wolves, or at least of the ideals they symbolize, still runs deep. The challenge is to provide a whole sense of the animal and hope that with knowledge comes acceptance.</p>
<p>To educate people about wolves is to reveal an animal of stark contrasts and human-like behaviors. <br>I myself and my 8 year old daughter have a wolf at home he is our companion.

<p>Wolves are greatly misunderstood beings.

Imagine you live in the forest and you have babies and something you‚Äôve never seen before comes close to your babies. ¬†Would you defend them or act protective? Of course you would ! Well we are in their house when we walk in a forest and walk past a den ¬† So don‚Äôt go near their babies and you have no problem. They won‚Äôt attack unless you are stupid and provoke it. Just like you! Also did you know that wolves take care of their elderly just like humans do? Did you know there cases that wolves have helped and protected human beings? More cases of such than being hurt. Wolves also help our environment with trees and lakes. Wolves are also a sacred animal to our tribal communities. A lot of people have them as companions. I do and he‚Äôs remarkable. He gets along with my jack russell they are best of friends. Could you imagine someone hunting down and killing your pet or companion? I will be submitting video documents on wolves in the company of humans. ¬†I petition that the hunting of wolves be stopped because they are not a threat to human beings and that who ever hunts a wolf has a minimum fine of 100,000$ and is also punished with a minimum jail sentence of 1 year and not allowed to own any domesticated animal nor have possession of ¬†¬†</p>",,,,,2.5017676,,,,,,,United States Supreme Court: Stop Hunting Wolves,,,,,,,,,,

This is displayed as their logo in front of their building and most of all the state buildings. Not understanding the war bonnet has significant meaning in indigenous culture. The war bonnet signifies something that is earned and has a different in meaning per tribe. Each feather on the headdress represented an achievement, whether that be an act of bravery on the battlefield or accomplishing a great deed for one‚Äôs own tribe. There are some tribes that their war bonnets were earned by scalping and obtaining a lock of hair to add with their feather, which was NOT practiced by all First Nations Tribes. The COLONIZERS were actually the people who did scalp the indigenous people of the land.</p>
<p>With that, it is highly respected and is earned not passed down. Now what most POC are experiencing with Arapahoe County is systemic racism, and cannot fight the abuse done to families within their power. They continue to steal our children, kill the mothers, and try to take our dignity as much as possible. I am a testament of this, as I am still fighting for one visit with my child. I have not seen my son in 11 years since the day of an accidentally scratch, not through the ARAPAHOE COUNTY courts, CPS, a Guardium a lite, not a therapist, not even one supervised visit. THEY NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED they are the most prejudice COUNTY IN COLORADO, all they want is money.</p>
<p>This year 2020, Luis (my stepfather the 1 who purchased my son) through ARAPAHOE COUNTY Combined Courts in Centennial, Colorado, has served me with the 2nd Petition of Adoption and Termination of Parental Rights. My rights are still intact! PLEASE take time &amp; READ A LETTER TO LUIS (plaintiff) &amp; HIS LAWYER from a grieving mother and family.</p>
<p>Dear Luis and Kristi,</p>
<p>I would like to propose a mediation where there is an agreement/discussion about a relationship with mother and son. This would solely rely on what Charlie is wanting from his own future. I am not asking that you give me full custody or even temporary custody. I am simply asking for an opportunity to let Charlie know that his mother loves him dearly, as this has not happened since the day of the accidental scratch, due to our differences on how this situation is viewed per our personal beliefs.</p>
<p>I fought ridiculously hard for 8 years, and because of a private (not mandatory) restraining order, a physical relationship was not allowed with mother and son. I was under the impression; the only reason reintegration therapy did not start was because I had to pay Kristi‚Äôs fees before that was a possibility. Other than a physical relationship with Charlie, I have always made every effort to ensure Charlie had a connection to all his family, he knows I love him according to every single family member that does get a rare chance to visit with him. They make it a point to tell him that his mother loves him very much. Not only that, anytime my other children are in Colorado or can get together with Charlie, my mother will do everything in her power to get a relationship between brothers and siblings. When he receives a gift from his immediate birth family it is always very thoughtful and sent every year, sometimes they are returned by Luis.</p>
<p>I would like to make this extremely clear; I would never abandon any of my children, I will keep fighting for the opportunity to tell him I love him. This is one thing that can never be changed in me as a mother to all these amazing kids, I cannot and will not give up on loving them. I still would like to get to know him for all he has to offer this world, and care for him enough to tell him he will always have a family that loves him very much. He holds a place in my heart that will never be replaced, a name is just a name, but I rather have him to genuinely want that for himself. My goal here is not to rip Charlie from a home that he has known for the first part of his life. I want him to know who we are, where he comes from, have that unbreakable relationship with his brothers, to hear and know that this Nunez family has not stopped thinking about him since the day he has left, that we love him always, and we will never leave his side (metaphorically as there is a restraining order still in place prohibiting contact for mom), I also want him to know that his culture will be here in this home always.</p>
<p>Luis as an adopted child, you should have some sympathy for Charlie. I am sure you would have liked to hear you mother tell you she loves you so much, and will always be there for you if you need her before you were adopted. I may not know all the psychology behind the child‚Äôs thinking in these situations, but I am remarkably familiar with therapy. Therapy is a wonderful tool and I believe everyone, especially Charlie and you could benefit with the trauma of being adopted. I do not want to cause any trauma to Charlie, he has been through enough of that. I am asking that I have an opportunity to tell him I love him even it is supervised, in hopes he would willing want to continue to build a relationship with his birth family.</p>
<p>I am not in agreeance with this adoption; however, I am not here to traumatize Charlie, but I want to come to an agreement that Charlie deserves as much love and family as possible. As well as letting his voice be heard for once, neither yourself or Charlie has had a mental health evaluation or has an opinion from a doctored psychologist. Dr. Richard Spiegel PhD is an amazing therapist who specializes in case like ours, as we have all agreed that his resume is the therapist to mediate the situation. On top of all that I know Charlie would not be disappointed in his office as it is the most beautiful and welcoming place to be. Please send me back a response as quickly as possible, as I would like to save us both a lot of time and money into the court system.</p>
<p>Thanks kindly</p>
<p>Please, we are begging anyone and everyone to help restore our family and end this injustice, not just for my family but many families. I am not asking for money; I am simply asking for the people‚Äôs time to share my story and help fight these cruel people. The punishment that my family has received is very cruel and unusual. I am sure I am not the only family suffering this trauma. Let us get answers to why this is happening. This is part of my journey and I want my son to know I love him, and I would never stop fighting for his VOICE to be heard. Mind you I have all my other children living at home with me, when this started my second child was 6 months and they never took him from me.</p>
<p>As indigenous people we all know what the affects of residential schools did to our culture, but we can fix it. We need to help with all issues that are affecting our rights. Please demand an investigation into my case and other cases handled by the judges/magistrates that made orders to sell my child to the highest bidder. The goal for children that are taken into the system is reunification, but the question is why in cases like mine was that not the best interest of our children?</p>",,,,,2.2896123,,,,,,,"Michael F.

Within the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, one program being looked at is the Child Development Labs.¬†</p>
<p>The Child Labs has been a part of UCONN for <strong>over 75 years</strong>. It provides</p>
<ul>
<li>an enriching, safe, and nurturing environment for children and families from UCONN &amp; local community;</li>
<li>a model training center for HDFS (Department of Human Development &amp; Family Sciences) students working on early childhood education and related fields;</li>
<li>a top-notch research site in the field of child development for scholars at UCONN &amp; the State of Connecticut.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with many early care programs, the Child Labs was closed in Fall 2020 due to COVID-19 risks. They reopened in January <em>at half of the capacity</em> due to COVID-Policies in order to support families and UConn students. And<em> there are currently 30 early childhood education students</em> who are participating in practicum experiences at the Child Labs.</p>
<p>The Child Labs has a superb reputation among families and supports families at all different income levels. Before the pandemic, it was quite common for families to stay months on the waiting list before getting a spot. <strong>We hope and have confidence that the full capacity operations at the Child Labs will soon be restored as the CT State rolls out COVID-19 vaccines and reopens.</strong></p>
<p>Now is absolutely NOT the time to make long-term decisions for the Child Labs based on short-term hardships.</p>

<p><strong>What We Ask</strong></p>
<p><em>Families, Alumni, HDFS Students, and Child Labs Friends</em> - Please SIGN and SHARE your personal and/or professional connection to UCONN Child Labs, and why it should continue functioning as an affordable and integral member of our UCONN and Mansfield community.¬†</p>

Depp was removed from the movie Pirates of the Caribbean by Walt Disney‚Äôs Company. This unfortunately is due to his ex wife Amber Heard lying and stating that Depp beat her. It has been proven that he did not hit her, but yet, that she beat on him repeatedly. She hit him with pots and pans 24/7 as if that was okay. This may come as a joke to some, but abuse towards a man or woman is not to be taken lightly. Now that this has come to light, Johnny Depp still has not been redeemed of this false news.</p>
<p>Amber Heard ruined Johnny Depp‚Äôs life as well as career. Johnny Depp has always been one of the greatest actors ever since he started acting around the age of 21. This man NEVER disappoints when he makes a movie, so why continue to keep him from doing Pirates of the Caribbean?? That movie is nothing without him! Please sign this petition to help Johnny Depp get back to what he enjoys and does best.</p>
<p>And Now in 2021, Amber Heard's lawyer has confirmed Amber did not donate her divorce settlement to charity and therefor lied to dying children and committed perjury in the UK</p>

Brenda Burdue Savage, the woman who was arrested, admitted she shot Bart and eyewitness accounts reported she did so ""for no reason"". She was released on $100,000 bond the following day, January 31, 2019, by Special Judge Mindy Beare. The ADA Adam R.Scharn took it upon his personal judgment by the accused looks that she couldn‚Äôt afford the 100,000 bond so instead of like all other murder cases in Pittsburg county Oklahoma of higher bonds for murder, he didn‚Äôt even fight this low bond.Our family does not have money or clout in the area but Bart was a lifelong, active member of the Choctaw community, was raised and participated in ceremonial dances but above all deserves the respect allowed to capital murder. <br>The district attorney chuck Sullivan sent out an email advising his staff not to communicate with our family anymore. Thru an open records request we learned that not one employee has received any trading on Marcys law as stated in Oklahoma constitutional law. Merrill Williamson from the attorney general office , refused to hear my concerns and complaints regarding constitutional violations, will not answer emails or calls.

Now You only have to Google her name to find out that <em><strong>she's been arrested for 'misdemeanor domestic violence</strong></em>'. So how is it that Amber still gets to reprise her role as Mera in aquaman 2, yet Johnny has been axed of his role as¬†Grindelwald in fantastic beasts 3?</p>
<p>I know the media are claiming it's because Amber Heard has a contract with Warner bros and so that they cannot fire her but so did Johnny. He had a contract for his role as Grindelwald and yet they still managed to fire him. To me this shows that Warner bros not only agrees with abuse and domestic violence but also sides with a woman who has a repitation for it. <em><strong>Johnny has proved his innocence with solid evidence multiple times but due to the fact he's Male, he's been silenced.</strong></em> This is a huge problem amongst itself and it's time we make a change by boycotting aquaman 2 and fantastic beasts 3.</p>
<p><em><strong>This shows Warner bros that we STAND by Male victims of domestic abuse/violence and we don't side with Amber Heard</strong></em>.

He captures many eyes with his eccentric and unique characters, his charming charisma , and his contagious humour, which seems to ignite a spark of humbleness within us all.</p>
<p>His works like¬†Public Enemies, Pirates of the Caribbean Series, Finding Neverland, dark Shadows, Sweeny Todd,Sleepy Hollow( I could go on)¬†have shown his versatility and his great depths to which he can go and is praised all over the world. His ability to go to any extent for his characters, is just phenomenal.</p>
<p>You may not like the guy, but you can't deny he has skill and talent.</p>
<p><em><strong>‚ÄúWith any part you play, there is a certain amount of yourself in it. There has to be, otherwise it‚Äôs just not acting. It‚Äôs lying‚Äù</strong></em></p>
<p>What I admire most about <strong>Depp</strong>, is his commitment and dedication to his job. He doesn't treat it as a job, thus a different way of breathing. A different way of expression. He stands by the idea that "" we are all somewhat screwy in a way"" and that we should embrace our weirdness and imperfections.</p>
<p>I used to believe that i was insignificant. That I was made to feel different. Because I didn't dress a particular way, or I didn't think the 'right' way. But <strong>Johnny Depp</strong> made me feel that it was okay to be me.</p>
<p>He has inspired me to live my life to the full. With smiles and laughter and through enjoyment.</p>
<p>Please don't take him from our screens. Please don't take away the man that inspires me to not survive. But to live.</p>

<p><strong>Johnny</strong> has brought nothing but happiness and joy to our hearts, innocence and clarity from our souls, and the laughter and smiles from our lips when we were sad.</p>
<p>He has touched my heart and opened my mind.</p>
<p>So please Don't crush his reputation , he is not a piece of dirt you can kick with your shoe, he is not a product of society. He is a man. With family,¬† with problems, and with a heart.</p>
<p><br>We should all be trying to work together , we all need to be little more understanding.</p>
<p><br>It is not good to be singled minded. For it means your mind is closed to other ideas or opinions. And if you are not open to any other ideas or opinions then you are intolerant of them. This is called bigotry. Bigotry is an ugly thing, and is often found alongside of other deplorable traits such as arrogance, conceitedness and narcissism.</p>
<p>It is much better to have an open mind, The best way to knowledge is to explore. As soon as you put the breaks on exploration, you are being single minded. All this does is slow down progress.</p>
<p>Life is not just seeing whats in front of you or hearing something from your next door neighbor. You have to delve in much deeper than that. I think it's time to look over the rainbow.</p>

<li><em>""Because as a male victim of abuse, seeing [Johnny Depp‚Äôs] reputation be ruined and stay ruined even after heaps of evidence came out showing that he was the victim, made me feel abandoned. I support [Johnny Depp] to show others like myself they‚Äôre not alone."" ‚Äî @lightrey</em></li>
<li><em>""Because I‚Äôve experienced a version of Amber Heard. I‚Äôve seen how female abusers work. And male victims of [Domestic Violence] deserve to be seen."" ‚Äî @m1che11ePearl</em></li>
<li><em>""It was obvious to me almost from the outset that her claims were questionable and that the media coverage was biased. The more facts emerged, the more strongly I felt a real injustice was being done. I was incensed by the media, in particular. Later, it was the way [Amber Heard] used her claims to build a platform as an activist and the way she was enabled by various organisations which I found disgraceful. She has exploited victims (and I am a [domestic violence] survivor myself) for personal gain &amp; should be held accountable."" ‚Äî @redlikejungle</em></li>
<li><em>""Having been a victim myself‚Ä¶.I could see [Johnny Depp‚Äôs] life coming out of his eyes when he was with her‚Ä¶.Violence has no gender. All victims...survivors deserve to be heard‚Ä¶and anyone using important platforms to further themselves, are horrible"". ‚Äî @Farrartina1212</em></li>
<li><em>""I grew up in an abusive household, so when the accusations came out, I was like, ‚Äúwell‚Ä¶Amber isn‚Äôt acting like me‚Ä¶but Depp is‚Äù. It was so many social signs that I, myself, could relate to. How withdrawn he was‚Ä¶versus the OVER confidence she exuded. I related to him."" ‚Äî @lilyjane916</em></li>
</ul>
<p><br>There are dozens more. These are just some of the voices that make up the choir of <strong>Johnny Depp‚Äôs</strong> online supporters. Survivors, fans , humans. They are individuals who took the time to dig beyond the headlines and media and surfaced saying, ‚Äúsomething isn‚Äôt right.‚Äù They¬†care!</p>
<p>You do not need to agree with them. You do not need to engage with them. But hearing them, listening to them, and trying for a moment to truly understand them, is a good place to start.</p>
<p>This is not only for <strong>Johnny</strong>, but for the men and who are suffering quietly, from abuse. No one should be made to feel worthless, or exploited unruly.</p>
<p>I assume the foundation of this idea comes from the belief that women have an easier time reporting, and expressing their situation because people are more accepting and helpful when it comes to them. Also,¬†I often hear people say that men are humiliated and ashamed by being abused, as if women aren‚Äôt. That is offensive. It not only assumes that a woman‚Äôs right to control her own agency and life is somehow less potent, or less important than a man‚Äôs, it also assumes a woman has an easier time revealing her situation, because, well, women are simply allowed to seem weak.</p>
<p>It definitely happens. One reason it's less of a concern is because men are supposedly more capable of defending themselves and less likely to be injured.</p>
<p>I say ‚Äúsupposedly‚Äù because even though this is often physically true, men can get in a whole lot of trouble for defending themselves especially if they cause any injury to the woman in the process. He is a lot more likely to go to jail than she is EVEN IF she is the one who is doing the abusing. Now how is that fair. It isn't? But we can change that.</p>
<p>If that is the case, are you telling me that defending ones self is a crime if your a man?</p>
<p>¬†</p>

<p>I am L, and I am a domestic violence survivor. I have three friends with equally horrid experiences, two other women and one man.</p>
<p>With the other young woman, I have held her two-year-old daughter in my arms who called my lap a ‚Äúsafety place‚Äù because ‚Äúdaddy‚Äôs mad again‚Äù and tried to cover her ears while her father was abusing my friend and shouting at her downstairs. I gave witness testimony to the police the very next day which was the starting point of long and very painful recovery for my friend and her daughter. My other female friend tried to leave a man that she had realised was aggressive and dangerous; as a result he attempted to throw her from the balcony of the 4th floor to concrete pavement. All his other physical assaults before that were of similar gravity. My male friend is an exceptionally mild-mannered and kind-hearted man despite being also a 6‚Äô3 tall bodybuilder. His ex-girlfriend is much smaller, but the scratches and bruises on his skin we saw where nothing to joke about let alone the time she used a knife during one of her very frequent frenzies of rage.</p>
<p>I want to make our voices heard as Amber Heard has been recently listed as one of your spokespeople to talk, for profit, as ""An outspoken advocate for women's rights and for the civil rights of survivors of all gender-based violence around the world"" as described on your site. This is extremely disheartening and offensive beyond belief to all people, and their close ones, who have first-hand experience of domestic violence.</p>
<p>There are numerous audio tapes where Ms Heard proudly admits having assaulted her then husband on several occasions. She admits having hit him, kicked him and having thrown multiple objects at him. She verbally abuses him on these very tapes, shouts at him, and mocks him for being a male victim of domestic violence and ridicules that the world would never believe him. Each of these acts is an act of domestic violence and is unpardonable. Furthermore, there is an ever-growing number of impartial witnesses that have testified under oath of the violent and abusive behaviour of Ms Heard against her ex-husband and that it has been regular and frequent. These statements include ones provided by two LAPD police officers trained to recognise any potential signals of domestic violence. These witness statements are fully supported by communications and medical statements, which also reveal her to be addicted to class A drugs and alcohol. She has furthermore been arrested for domestic violence against her former partner and there is evidence of regular abuse of her own baby sister, such as a video tape displaying her with bruises on her arms and skin. It is beyond reasonable doubt that she is guilty of domestic violence.</p>
<p>Domestic violence, against women or men, is a matter of utmost seriousness and no proven and self-admitted abuser should be allowed a platform to mock the genuine survivors, let alone profit of their suffering. Are these the values Harry Walker Agency represent? Are these the values that You, Mr Don Walker and Mrs Ellen Kazis-Walker represent? It is utterly bewildering that any organisation or a person with conscience could support such conduct.</p>
<p>I speak on the behalf of several domestic violence survivors in writing this open letter to you to do what is right and remove this proven and self-admitted domestic abuser from your list of spokespeople. It breaks my heart, and I am not alone, not only to see yet another abuser to be not held accountable for her deeds but generating profits and visibility on the expense of genuine survivors.</p>
<p>Sincerely Yours,</p>

<p>Johnny Depp has already been removed from multiple movie franchises and big productions because of this clearly false claim, and now The Walt Disney Company has put a direct ban of him appearing in the Pirates of the Caribbean series.</p>

Then in the end it was found out that they weren't true, but Johnny's character was already married by her false statements. Disney, being the greedy corporate conglomerates that they are, fired him. Now, Netflix and Starz have removed him from their platforms. As well as WB from the Fantastic Beasts movies.¬†</p>
