* He shows up late to set, often drunk and/or on drugs.
* He insists on wearing an earpiece because he refuses to learn lines.
* He insists on having three assistants, including a $200,000 a year executive assistant who must travel first class.
* While filming Dead Men Tell No Tales he swallowed eight ecstasy tablets at once.

The only reason a huge, multimillionaire star and lead actor in a major movie franchise would get dropped in Hollywood is if they couldn't insure him any more. And a lot of the reasons why a person would be deemed too costly to insure would be drug/alcohol addiction, particularly of the variety that makes a person unable to work in a reliable fashion, especially in an industry like Hollywood, where time is fucking everything. Johnny Depp has been late, holding up shooting, and a lot of the time, refuses to show up for commitments he promises he'd show up for. If you don't fucking show up for work, you'll get fired.

But even that could be excusable, provided he had a team who could get him to where he needs to be on time, or if there are people in the industry who are powerful enough and capable enough to vouch for him, in spite of all that. Except Johnny Depp has been spending the better part of the last few years burning bridges with anyone who could bother to defend him. [This article says it all:](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/hes-radioactive-inside-johnny-depps-self-made-implosion)

>""One studio executive who has worked with Depp in recent years says  his inner demons had long ago bled into his professional life, making  him ""a huge liability"" thanks to frequent tardiness and costly behavior,  all cataloged in the U.K. suit.  
>  
>""The discovery that came out in that trial alone would be enough to scare any studio,"" says the executive."" 

And he has a shitty team of professionals to run his life:

>To many observers, Depp's negative press was largely avoidable and  stemmed from his aggressive legal tactics. The chief architect behind  Depp's sue-'em-all strategy is Adam Waldman, a handsome Washington  lawyer with his own sheen of controversy given a clientele that has  included Russian oligarchs and Julian Assange. Waldman, who is married  to Berlin-based jet-setter and luxury skin-care entrepreneur Barbara  Sturm, conducts himself in an unorthodox manner, mocking his legal  opponents on Twitter. Sources say Depp met Waldman through Saudi Arabian  Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the country's powerful minister of energy,  in summer 2016. (Depp spent time aboard the prince's megayacht in the  past.)

And this was after he fired his agent of three decades, sued his long term business manager, and also sued his entertainment lawyer and supposed ""father figure."" 

Not only that, but because he's proceeding with the legal actions against Heard in America now, there's a chance he'll be asked to air not just his dirty laundry, but that of other people as well.

* He allegedly punched a crew member twice on the set of City of Lies, resulting in a lawsuit that's still ongoing.
* He shows up late to set, often drunk and/or on drugs.
* He insists on wearing an earpiece because he refuses to learn lines.
* He insists on having three assistants, including a $200,000 a year executive assistant who must travel first class.
* While filming Dead Men Tell No Tales he swallowed eight ecstasy tablets at once.

The only reason a huge, multimillionaire star and lead actor in a major movie franchise would get dropped in Hollywood is if they couldn't insure him any more. And a lot of the reasons why a person would be deemed too costly to insure would be drug/alcohol addiction, particularly of the variety that makes a person unable to work in a reliable fashion, especially in an industry like Hollywood, where time is fucking everything. Johnny Depp has been late, holding up shooting, and a lot of the time, refuses to show up for commitments he promises he'd show up for. If you don't fucking show up for work, you'll get fired.

But even that could be excusable, provided he had a team who could get him to where he needs to be on time, or if there are people in the industry who are powerful enough and capable enough to vouch for him, in spite of all that. Except Johnny Depp has been spending the better part of the last few years burning bridges with anyone who could bother to defend him. [This article says it all:](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/hes-radioactive-inside-johnny-depps-self-made-implosion)

>""One studio executive who has worked with Depp in recent years says  his inner demons had long ago bled into his professional life, making  him ""a huge liability"" thanks to frequent tardiness and costly behavior,  all cataloged in the U.K. suit.  
>  
>""The discovery that came out in that trial alone would be enough to scare any studio,"" says the executive."" 

And he has a shitty team of professionals to run his life:

>To many observers, Depp's negative press was largely avoidable and  stemmed from his aggressive legal tactics. The chief architect behind  Depp's sue-'em-all strategy is Adam Waldman, a handsome Washington  lawyer with his own sheen of controversy given a clientele that has  included Russian oligarchs and Julian Assange. Waldman, who is married  to Berlin-based jet-setter and luxury skin-care entrepreneur Barbara  Sturm, conducts himself in an unorthodox manner, mocking his legal  opponents on Twitter. Sources say Depp met Waldman through Saudi Arabian  Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the country's powerful minister of energy,  in summer 2016. (Depp spent time aboard the prince's megayacht in the  past.)

And this was after he fired his agent of three decades, sued his long term business manager, and also sued his entertainment lawyer and supposed ""father figure."" 

Not only that, but because he's proceeding with the legal actions against Heard in America now, there's a chance he'll be asked to air not just his dirty laundry, but that of other people as well. So he's been burning down bridges and pissing on the ashes as well, and he has surrounded himself by some of the worst people to be with right now. None of this leaves studio execs much room for optimism.",22,22

Putting aside the awful rag that is the sun, here's something from the BBC:

Jenny Afia of Schillings law firm, who represented Mr Depp, said: ""This decision is as perverse as it is bewildering.

""Most troubling is the judge's reliance on the testimony of Amber Heard, and corresponding disregard of the mountain of counter-evidence from police officers, medical practitioners, her own former assistant, other unchallenged witnesses and an array of documentary evidence which completely undermined the allegations, point by point.""

""The judgement is so flawed that it would be ridiculous for Mr Depp not to appeal this decision,"" she added.

Edit: I should mention the case is so ridiculous that the sun / person that wrote the story weren't even called as witnesses.

The sun (and the person that wrote it) didn't even appear as a witness in the case. It was her in court as a witness saying he'd abused her. That's the case to defend the sun. Her testimony.
Regardless of what she did to him, the judge believed her that he'd hit her.

Basically the whole thing seems to be that they had a fucked up relationship (and that's giving her the benefit of the doubt). It *seems* she was indeed the abuser (actual evidence for this include recordings of her hitting him and saying nobody would believe him, him needing surgery after having glass thrown at him, her shitting in his bed and other incidents) but he physically retaliated at times (haven't seen any actual proof of this even quoted but apparently happened on a few occasions).

Now back to the point. This post is here because she's now trying to represent VICTIMS of abuse. That is seriously fucked up and people have a right to be angry. That's what the post is about.
Looks like she was right when she told him that nobody would believe him.

Depp says, “No! When you have a f***ing closed fist.”

>I'm not sure about this. The letter of UK libel law is pretty strict but also British tabloids exist so it doesn't seem very strict in practice.

What is this even supposed to mean. The existence of tabloids doesn't mean libel laws are not strict. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libel_tourism

The whole reason why newspapers UK tabloids tend to get entangled up into scandals is because they are more afraid of libel lawsuits, so they push the journalists to go to extremes and skirt the edge of what's legal or moral in trying to get solid evidence that can survive a court of law in case they get sued",20,20

That is a rundown of everything that has happened, it is unbiased so you can draw your own conclusion.

Take note how he has had previous partners, police officers and medical practitioners come forward with evidence of abuse from Amber Heard. 

Depp also released counseling recording that has Amber Heard admitting to wrong doing and says to quote:

>	""I can't promise you I won't get physical again. God, I f---ing sometimes get so mad I lose it.""

There are other news articles and reports out there, I’ll also link to the raw audio that Depp released below.

Apparently Amber also accused Depp of the assault during the texts in question and shared multiple photos of herself with visible injuries after requesting a restraining order. However when the police were called to the scene over a domestic call they found no evidence of any physical injuries after examining her. I do not know though if these were the same text messages used in the court case with the Sun tabloid defending their use of the term wife beater or a different set of texts sent between them. 

However she’s fabricated so much evidence and made so many claims, I can see why people are skeptical of her claims, and also why they’ll be appealing the verdict. Her also being arrested for physically abusing a previous partner prior to this whole shitshow with Johnny Depp is also concerning.
