According to his assistant, Depp was “appalled” and “when I told him he kicked you, he cried”. The assistant went on to say, “it was disgusting and he knows it”.

>Depp later texted Heard to apologize personally and promise it would never happen again.

>Depp also texted Paul Bettany discussing how how he went too far with drugs and alcohol on that flight and he needed to cut back. He had also texted Bettany about being in a rage and blacked out in a text that can be found here.

>Then, during the trial, Depp and the assistant changed their stories. They said that Depp hadn’t really hurt her, that it was a “playful tap”.

I cannot find anything recent from Depp or his lawyers claiming he hit Greg Brooks. He maintains no punches were thrown. In fact, here is a selfie with Depp at the request of Greg Brooks that was made when Brooks had calmed down:
https://theblast.com/c/johnny-depp-selfie-photo-evidence-assault-lawsuit-rocky-brooks-trial

""Depp is expected to testify that he did not hit Brooks, but rather confronted him verbally after he saw Brooks acting belligerently toward a woman on set. Depp’s attorneys have also argued in pre-trial briefs that there is no evidence suggesting that Depp had any hand in preventing Brooks from getting work.""

Also, it was a freakin movie set. Depp has eyewitnesses and time-stamped media proving his case:
“After all the evidence from multiple sworn eyewitness testimony and dozens of contemporaneous photographs taken by the script supervisor, Mr. Brooks has finally found a single witness to support his absurd, delusional claim — his own lawyer,” Waldman said. “As soon as the evidence defeats Mr. Brooks in trial we will immediately launch malicious prosecution claims against his attorneys. What Mr. Brooks lawyer terms ‘scorched earth’ is actually known as ‘Justice.'”

151,https://screenrant.com/wb-amber-heard-johnny-depp-aquaman-2-fire-different/,2,1,"('Mycroft033',)",{1},reddit,reddits,t1_godpmun,"No, Amber would be one of the ones who would know whether or not she was fired and she is contractually obligated to be honest about it because if she was actually fired and she said she wasn’t, that would be bad. She just added a bunch of baggage about how “stupid” it was because she’s a shit human being. However she’s contractually obligated to be truthful about it, or at least in line with what the studio wants to say publicly. If she ends up getting axed later, awesome, but for now WB has basically stated that AH is still on for all intents and purposes. 

[Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/wb-amber-heard-johnny-depp-aquaman-2-fire-different/) actually did a good analysis on this, one of the few actually good summaries I’ve seen from them. Essentially it boils down to the fact that the court of public opinion is not as powerful as the actual legal court system. The actual legal court system has precedent on the side of Heard, however unfair that may be, the result of this is that studios will not have a huge incentive to axe her from the film. The boycott has reached about two million supporters (of which I am one) but let’s be real, two million boycotters is a tiny number compared to the hundreds of millions who are still probably going to watch the movie. 

The only way this could actually change is if Amber loses the Virginia case, which should ideally happen if the judge isn’t a personal friend of hers like justice Nichol. If she loses that case, then she’s much more likely to be axed, and I personally suspect the studio is quietly bringing her screen time down for this reason, because the court case would happen mid-filming, and if she was cut mid-filming, the impact to the movie can only be reduced by having reduced screen time for her character.",3,3

I consider myself a feminist but with everything I know about their accusations I don’t believe a word Amber Heard says...that’s my opinion anyways. There is an unknown number of legitimately abused women who suffer in silence and public accusations may give them the courage to come forward, but false accusations can also hurt real victims as well.  For me, the most telling piece of evidence is the recorded conversations between Johnny and Amber.  Now it seems that Johnny may have known that they were being recorded and Amber may not have so Johnny may be a little careful with what he says.  Regardless, Amber’s words and demeanor just don’t strike me as a woman who is being abused and fearful of her abuser.  In the recordings she admits to hitting him and says something to the effect of not being able to promise she won’t get physical again..that she gets so angry she loses it.  That statement right there indicates that she is aware of her behavior but tries to justify it under the guise of not being able to control herself. I work in a field where I regularly deal with victims of domestic violence. Women who are abused are usually fearful of their abusers and feel like they have to walk on eggshells to not enrage them, and every perceived slight from the abuser leads to them lashing out at their victim, whether the slight is only imagined or not. I’m not saying that all abused women don’t fight back, but the overwhelming majority of long time domestic violence victims don’t threaten their abuser with physical violence...particularly women who are smaller and weaker then a male partner.  Now those recordings in themselves are enough to make me believe that Amber is not a victim and at the very least, they’re mutual combatants in a violent and tumultuous relationship. However when you add other known factors in, it leads me to believe that not only is Amber not a victim, but she may actually be an abuser.  

Amber was previously arrested for allegedly assaulting her ex girlfriend in a public place, in plain view of police officers. She was observed allegedly striking the woman, grabbing her arm, and ripping a necklace off her neck. THOSE are the actions of an abuser. And if that was how she treated her in public, I can only imagine how she acts behind closed doors, particularly if alcohol or drugs are involved.  Now to be fair, her ex denied the allegations and the charges were dropped and later, at Amber’s (or her attorneys) request, deleted from the system...But Amber’s ex could be reacting as an abuse victim...protecting her abuser, denying allegations, and blaming others (in this case the police officers who saw the incident and stepped in).  I believe Amber and her ex may have even tried to claim that the officers were homophobic and misogynistic, but I think one of the officers came forward and stated that she was a lesbian and feminist and denied their allegations of prejudice.  Once again abusers will blame their victims and others for their actions and the victim will often protect them...I’ve seen it so many times speaking to DV victims who swear their partner didn’t hurt them while they have visible bruises on their face and body. That is THE reason a lot of states enacted mandatory  domestic violence arrest laws where officers can make an arrest even if the victim is being uncooperative or denying abuse when the officer has reason to believe the abuse occurred (I.e black eyes, bruises, etc).  So now not only do you have her own words saying she can’t control herself, but you have an instance of past abuse allegations that was allegedly witnessed in a public place by police officers.  On the contrary, all of Johnny’s exes claim he was never abusive with them and even provided written statements saying as such. While I wouldn’t necessarily take their word for it, there’s witnesses who claim they saw Amber abusing a partner, and none (other than Amber’s sister who she allegedly also abused) that saw Johnny abusing Amber.  She’s also changed dates when confronted with evidence that proved she wasn’t injured in the form of photographs and witness testimony.  And when she changed those dates, her one and only witness, her sister, also changed the dates.  All of the people that were close to Amber and Johnny as a couple also claimed that Amber was the abuser. Not a single person who came forward (once again w the exception of Amber’s sister) said they saw Johnny ever be violent towards Amber, but most of them said that Amber was violent with him.  This includes Amber’s own former personal assistant.  As I stated, the only reason I even care about these celebrities or their civil suits and allegations is because I’m a strong advocate for women’s rights and holding domestic violence abusers accountable for their actions. But when women who aren’t victims claim they are, they risk real victims not being believed.  I think another allegation that speaks towards Amber’s character is claiming a rape that happened to one of her employees was her own experience. If that’s true that is absolutely abhorrent to me. 

These suits are being handled in civil courts. The burden of proof in civil courts is not nearly as high as the burden of proof in criminal courts. In criminal cases it’s beyond a reasonable doubt, in civil cases it’s a preponderance of the evidence.  That means if the jury or judge believes that there’s a 51% chance the allegations are true and a 49% chance they’re not, they will rule in their favor.  Civil court is a joke imo and I put zero stock into their rulings.  So regardless of what happens between the two of them in court, no matter who the rulings favor, that in no way is truly indicative of the truth.  I believe Johnny lost the initial suit against the Sun.  The Sun made like 14 allegations of abuse against Depp citing only Amber’s allegations.  The judge only had to believe that ONE of the 14 allegations could be true...that is an insane standard to beat, especially when you’re only going off of one parties word.  IMO Amber seems like a manipulative and unhinged person and I just don’t believe her.  I don’t believe Depp is 100% innocent for that matter, but I do believe that Amber was the primary emotional and physical aggressor and the abusive party.  You can hear it in the recordings from her own words.  She puts Depp down insinuating he’s old and fat and then refuses to take any responsibility for her physical aggression, instead insisting that Depp is responsible for her actions because he doesn’t stay around to endure her abuse.  I’m sure I’m going to get a lot of heat on this thread for my comment but it’s what I truly believe based on my experience.  I’m including links to some articles, I know they aren’t all the most reliable sources, but celebrity gossip and civil allegations aren’t often covered by the MSM.

I consider myself a feminist but with everything I know about their accusations I don’t believe a word Amber Heard says...that’s my opinion anyways. There is an unknown number of legitimately abused women who suffer in silence and public accusations may give them the courage to come forward, but false accusations can also hurt real victims as well.  For me, the most telling piece of evidence is the recorded conversations between Johnny and Amber.  Now it seems that Johnny may have known that they were being recorded and Amber may not have so Johnny may be a little careful with what he says.  Regardless, Amber’s words and demeanor just don’t strike me as a woman who is being abused and fearful of her abuser.  In the recordings she admits to hitting him and says something to the effect of not being able to promise she won’t get physical again..that she gets so angry she loses it.  That statement right there indicates that she is aware of her behavior but tries to justify it under the guise of not being able to control herself. I work in a field where I regularly deal with victims of domestic violence. Women who are abused are usually fearful of their abusers and feel like they have to walk on eggshells to not enrage them, and every perceived slight from the abuser leads to them lashing out at their victim, whether the slight is only imagined or not. I’m not saying that all abused women don’t fight back, but the overwhelming majority of long time domestic violence victims don’t threaten their abuser with physical violence...particularly women who are smaller and weaker then a male partner.  Now those recordings in themselves are enough to make me believe that Amber is not a victim and at the very least, they’re mutual combatants in a violent and tumultuous relationship. However when you add other known factors in, it leads me to believe that not only is Amber not a victim, but she may actually be an abuser.  

Amber was previously arrested for allegedly assaulting her ex girlfriend in a public place, in plain view of police officers. She was observed allegedly striking the woman, grabbing her arm, and ripping a necklace off her neck. THOSE are the actions of an abuser. And if that was how she treated her in public, I can only imagine how she acts behind closed doors, particularly if alcohol or drugs are involved.  Now to be fair, her ex denied the allegations and the charges were dropped and later, at Amber’s (or her attorneys) request, deleted from the system...But Amber’s ex could be reacting as an abuse victim...protecting her abuser, denying allegations, and blaming others (in this case the police officers who saw the incident and stepped in).  I believe Amber and her ex may have even tried to claim that the officers were homophobic and misogynistic, but I think one of the officers came forward and stated that she was a lesbian and feminist and denied their allegations of prejudice.  Once again abusers will blame their victims and others for their actions and the victim will often protect them...I’ve seen it so many times speaking to DV victims who swear their partner didn’t hurt them while they have visible bruises on their face and body. That is THE reason a lot of states enacted mandatory  domestic violence arrest laws where officers can make an arrest even if the victim is being uncooperative or denying abuse when the officer has reason to believe the abuse occurred (I.e black eyes, bruises, etc).  So now not only do you have her own words saying she can’t control herself, but you have an instance of past abuse allegations that was allegedly witnessed in a public place by police officers.  On the contrary, all of Johnny’s exes claim he was never abusive with them and even provided written statements saying as such. While I wouldn’t necessarily take their word for it, there’s witnesses who claim they saw Amber abusing a partner, and none (other than Amber’s sister who she allegedly also abused) that saw Johnny abusing Amber.  She’s also changed dates when confronted with evidence that proved she wasn’t injured in the form of photographs and witness testimony.  And when she changed those dates, her one and only witness, her sister, also changed the dates.  All of the people that were close to Amber and Johnny as a couple also claimed that Amber was the abuser. Not a single person who came forward (once again w the exception of Amber’s sister) said they saw Johnny ever be violent towards Amber, but most of them said that Amber was violent with him.

I’m including links to some articles, I know they aren’t all the most reliable sources, but celebrity gossip and civil allegations aren’t often covered by the MSM.

“I have found that the great majority of alleged assaults of Ms Heard by Mr Depp have been proved to the civil standard,” said Nicol. “The claimant has not succeeded in his action for libel.”

The judge ruled Depp's feelings towards his wife during their turbulent three-year relationship were summed up in a text where the actor revealed he had ""no mercy"" for her.

He also concluded Depp beat Ms Heard 12 times - starting in 2013 when he slapped the actress when she made a comment about his tattoo.

Over the course of their stormy marriage, the judge found Depp battered his wife after flying into drug and booze-fuelled rages.

But he dismissed two allegations made by Ms Heard in 2014 and 2015.

Not the right approach in my opinion.  If I was messing up grammar-wise I'd hope someone told me so I stopped doing it elsewhere.

Just be nice about it.  Make it clear you're just trying to be helpful instead of being insulting.  For example, [this is one way I tend to do it](https://reddit.com/r/ARK/comments/lp6lto/the_most_surprisiest_of_surprises/gob3s0l/?context=3).  I find approaching the issue in a way that's more ""educational"" tends to make people appreciative instead of defensive.  It shows you're trying to teach, not trying to diss.

I cannot find anything recent from Depp or his lawyers claiming he hit Greg Brooks. He maintains no punches were thrown. In fact, here is a selfie with Depp at the request of Greg Brooks that was made when Brooks had calmed down:
https://theblast.com/c/johnny-depp-selfie-photo-evidence-assault-lawsuit-rocky-brooks-trial

""Depp is expected to testify that he did not hit Brooks, but rather confronted him verbally after he saw Brooks acting belligerently toward a woman on set. Depp’s attorneys have also argued in pre-trial briefs that there is no evidence suggesting that Depp had any hand in preventing Brooks from getting work.""

Also, it was a freakin movie set. Depp has eyewitnesses and time-stamped media proving his case:
“After all the evidence from multiple sworn eyewitness testimony and dozens of contemporaneous photographs taken by the script supervisor, Mr. Brooks has finally found a single witness to support his absurd, delusional claim — his own lawyer,” Waldman said. “As soon as the evidence defeats Mr. Brooks in trial we will immediately launch malicious prosecution claims against his attorneys. What Mr. Brooks lawyer terms ‘scorched earth’ is actually known as ‘Justice.'”
