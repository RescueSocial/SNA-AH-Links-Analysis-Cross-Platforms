The only reason a huge, multimillionaire star and lead actor in a major movie franchise would get dropped in Hollywood is if they couldn't insure him any more. And a lot of the reasons why a person would be deemed too costly to insure would be drug/alcohol addiction, particularly of the variety that makes a person unable to work in a reliable fashion, especially in an industry like Hollywood, where time is fucking everything. Johnny Depp has been late, holding up shooting, and a lot of the time, refuses to show up for commitments he promises he'd show up for. If you don't fucking show up for work, you'll get fired.

But even that could be excusable, provided he had a team who could get him to where he needs to be on time, or if there are people in the industry who are powerful enough and capable enough to vouch for him, in spite of all that. Except Johnny Depp has been spending the better part of the last few years burning bridges with anyone who could bother to defend him. [This article says it all:](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/hes-radioactive-inside-johnny-depps-self-made-implosion)

>""One studio executive who has worked with Depp in recent years says  his inner demons had long ago bled into his professional life, making  him ""a huge liability"" thanks to frequent tardiness and costly behavior,  all cataloged in the U.K. suit.  
>  
>""The discovery that came out in that trial alone would be enough to scare any studio,"" says the executive."" 

And he has a shitty team of professionals to run his life:

>To many observers, Depp's negative press was largely avoidable and  stemmed from his aggressive legal tactics. The chief architect behind  Depp's sue-'em-all strategy is Adam Waldman, a handsome Washington  lawyer with his own sheen of controversy given a clientele that has  included Russian oligarchs and Julian Assange. Waldman, who is married  to Berlin-based jet-setter and luxury skin-care entrepreneur Barbara  Sturm, conducts himself in an unorthodox manner, mocking his legal  opponents on Twitter. Sources say Depp met Waldman through Saudi Arabian  Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the country's powerful minister of energy,  in summer 2016. (Depp spent time aboard the prince's megayacht in the  past.)

And this was after he fired his agent of three decades, sued his long term business manager, and also sued his entertainment lawyer and supposed ""father figure."" 

Not only that, but because he's proceeding with the legal actions against Heard in America now, there's a chance he'll be asked to air not just his dirty laundry, but that of other people as well. So he's been burning down bridges and pissing on the ashes as well, and he has surrounded himself by some of the worst people to be with right now.

Putting aside the awful rag that is the sun, here's something from the BBC:

Jenny Afia of Schillings law firm, who represented Mr Depp, said: ""This decision is as perverse as it is bewildering.

""Most troubling is the judge's reliance on the testimony of Amber Heard, and corresponding disregard of the mountain of counter-evidence from police officers, medical practitioners, her own former assistant, other unchallenged witnesses and an array of documentary evidence which completely undermined the allegations, point by point.""

""The judgement is so flawed that it would be ridiculous for Mr Depp not to appeal this decision,"" she added.

Amber is still in Aquaman 2, spokesperson for L'Oreal, and involved with nonprofits, and we support this.

We support businesses that help women who are domestically abused. 

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

- UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).

- Her detailed statements and citations of evidence, including her injuries, in UK's July 2020 NGN Trial: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7. 
- NGN's evidence in closing submissions for the UK Trial.
- Videos of ""Amber Heard Is Innocent"": Video One, Video Two, and Video Three on our Channel. Also, her side of Audio Two where she feared for her life.

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.
- Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

This thing? You know, when Depp tried to argue he wasn't a ""wife beater"" but the court said ""...but you did abuse her. Multiple times."" You can scroll all the way down for the final ruling.

Like seriously, read this

>""She’s begging for total global humiliation. She’s gonna get it. I’m gonna need your texts about San Francisco brother ... I’m even sorry to ask ... But she sucked Mollusk’s [I assume a reference to Elon Musk] crooked dick and he gave her some
>shitty lawyers ... I have no mercy, no fear and not an ounce of >emotion or what I once thought was love for this gold digging, low >level, dime a dozen, mushy, pointless dangling overused flappy fish market ... I’m so fucking happy she wants to fight this out!!! She will hit the wall hard!!! And I cannot wait to have this waste
>of a cum guzzler out of my life!!! I met fucking sublime little Russian here ... Which makes me realize the time I blew on that 50 cent stripper ... I wouldn’t touch her
>with a goddam glove. I can only hope that karma kicks in and takes the gift of breath from her ... Sorry man ... But NOW I will stop at nothing!!! Let’s see if
>Mollusk has a pair ... Come see me face to face ... I’ll show him things he’s never
>seen before ... Like the other side of his dick when I slice it off.""

and

>‘JD: Let’s burn Amber!!!

>PB: Having thought it through I don’t think we should burn Amber – she’s delightful company and easy on the eye, plus I’m not sure she’s a witch. We could of course try the English course of action in these predicaments – we do a drowning test. Thoughts?

>JD: Let’s drown her before we burn her!!! I will fuck her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she’s dead. 

and tell me with a straight face this is a normal, totally not crazy dude.

People seem to think this is a competition of who was worse, when all I did was call out the hypocrisy of the narrative shift that took place after the ruling came out.

Both of them are fucking gross.",,9.0,,,,9.0,,,,,reddit

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

- UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).
- Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>
- Her detailed statements and citations of evidence, including her injuries, in UK's July 2020 NGN Trial: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7. 
- NGN's evidence in closing submissions for the UK Trial.
- Videos of ""Amber Heard Is Innocent"": Video One, Video Two, and Video Three on our Channel. Also, her side of Audio Two where she feared for her life.

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.
- Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber is still in Aquaman 2, spokesperson for L'Oreal, and involved with nonprofits, and we support this.

We support businesses that help women who are domestically abused. 

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

- UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).

UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber is still in Aquaman 2, spokesperson for L'Oreal, and involved with nonprofits, and we support this.

We support businesses that help women who are domestically abused. 

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

- UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).
- Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>
- Her detailed statements and citations of evidence, including her injuries, in UK's July 2020 NGN Trial: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7. 
- NGN's evidence in closing submissions for the UK Trial.
- Videos of ""Amber Heard Is Innocent"": Video One, Video Two, and Video Three on our Channel. Also, her side of Audio Two where she feared for her life.
- See over 16 Videos, including Audio which was cut out of leaks, on Incredibly Incredible's Channel such as JD telling Amber to write to him every morning to tell him to not hurt her and text messages... <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg</a>

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.
- Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Take note how he has had previous partners, police officers and medical practitioners come forward with evidence of abuse from Amber Heard. 

Depp also released counseling recording that has Amber Heard admitting to wrong doing and says to quote:

So to frame any domestic violence situation as simply women provoking men into beating them is a terribly inaccurate take on the situation. 

When it comes to reciprocal violence unless you reach self defence levels then 'what if Depp provoked Heards  agggression' is not really a valid question. Would me saying what did Heard do to provoke Depps aggression be a fair question to ask?! What level of provocation is acceptable? If he insults her does he deserve to get a slap? 

As to your last point I don't know enough about the details to say if the level of response was appropriate.

That is a rundown of everything that has happened, it is unbiased so you can draw your own conclusion.

Take note how he has had previous partners, police officers and medical practitioners come forward with evidence of abuse from Amber Heard. 

Depp also released counseling recording that has Amber Heard admitting to wrong doing and says to quote:

>	""I can't promise you I won't get physical again. God, I f---ing sometimes get so mad I lose it.""

Amber Heard won and is innocent... UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

- UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.

Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

We hope for Amber's success in life long-term and thank her for her causes! It's changed lives for the better.
It's an assault against all women to silence Amber or other victims for speaking out against violence either in spoken words or Op-Eds.

The enabling culture of abuse that she spoke against in her Washington Post December 2018 Op-ed article is exactly what's being created after she wrote it by not allowing her to have support publicly or online by preventing progress.

We care and we want leaders like Amber Heard who advocate for equality!
It doesn't matter to these others how much philanthropy or good work she does - she's never perfect enough to them.

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

- UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).
- Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>
- Her detailed statements and citations of evidence, including her injuries, in UK's July 2020 NGN Trial: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7. 
- NGN's evidence in closing submissions for the UK Trial.
- Videos of ""Amber Heard Is Innocent"": Video One, Video Two, and Video Three on our Channel. - Also, her side of Audio Two where she feared for her life.

IO was the first to call 911 to protect Amber from her husband: <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html</a>

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.

Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

IO was the first to call 911 to protect Amber from her husband: <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html</a>

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.

Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

Amber Heard won and is innocent... UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

- UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).

Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

Amber Heard won and is innocent... UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

- UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).
- Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>
- Her detailed statements and citations of evidence, including her injuries, in UK's July 2020 NGN Trial: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7. 
- NGN's evidence in closing submissions for the UK Trial.
- Videos of ""Amber Heard Is Innocent"": Video One, Video Two, and Video Three on our Channel. - Also, her side of Audio Two where she feared for her life.
- See over 16 Videos, including Audio which was cut out of leaks, on Incredibly Incredible's Channel such as JD telling Amber to write to him every morning to tell him to not hurt her and text messages... <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg</a>

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead.""

I will personally explain what she tried to extort and paste the links, because you're a lazy S.O.B . 

She tried to get a Land Rover, three of his penthouses, 125k for legal fees and $50k a month payments until death. This can be found here: https://twitter.com/ifod_net/status/1025299758536110080?s=19

The donations she promised to charity which I will quote from Amber Heard: 
""As reported in the media, the amount received in the divorce was $7 million and $7 million is being donated. This is over and above any funds that I have given away in the past and will continue to give away in the future."" Link found here: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/johnny-depp-amber-heard-divorce-read-statement-full-settlement-charity-donation-a7198621.html

The Judge has now asked for receipts which Amber has tried to quash in court several times. Anyone who has donated, would be happy to hand those over, but not Amber, because she did not donate it. Request for receipts found here :https://twitter.com/LauraBockov/status/1340403775215988736?s=09

Information from the charity's website with a list of lifetime donors, which states she has not donated the money: https://twitter.com/RubiksGlass/status/1327389636184973314?s=19

Any further questions, or does this clear up the fact that Amber was only in it for the money? I have much more evidence through testimony and facts, that back up her need for money, so don't waste my time.",,6.0,,,,6.0,,,,,reddit

The donations she promised to charity which I will quote from Amber Heard:

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims.

Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

She has extensive evidence supporting her:

UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).

See over 16 Videos, including Audio which was cut out of leaks, on Incredibly Incredible's Channel such as JD telling Amber to write to him every morning to tell him to not hurt her and text messages... 
IO Tillett witnessed Amber's blood on a pillow and saw her injuries after Amber woke up from a violent fight that nearly suffocated her. IO was the first to call 911 to protect Amber from her husband: <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html</a>

According to an anonymous source saying she was the partner of ex-JD staff on social media March 29 to April 2019: Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots: google folder and video.

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.
Staff knew and saw that she was injured by Depp... When the source contacted us knowing she was abused, and showed us a missing person's photo of someone who was going to testify against JD, it made it our responsibility to try to help Amber Heard...

Our petition was encouraged by The Geek Buzz, a supporter of the 1938 comic issue of Superman stopping domestic violence. 

We hope for Amber's success in life long-term and thank her for her causes! It's changed lives for the better.
It's an assault against all women to silence Amber or other victims for speaking out against violence either in spoken words or Op-Eds.

The enabling culture of abuse that she spoke against in her Washington Post December 2018 Op-ed article is exactly what's being created after she wrote it by not allowing her to have support publicly or online by preventing progress.

We care and we want leaders like Amber Heard who advocate for equality!
It doesn't matter to these others how much philanthropy or good work she does - she's never perfect enough to them.

Amber Heard - Long-Time Charity, Philanthropy, and Activism:

- Started volunteering at age 12 and spent mornings at an Austin Soup Kitchen

- At age 16, took a stand against her school prom denying a same-sex couple entry by appealing to the ACLU

- Has traveled on Amnesty International research missions to the Mexico border, and brought awareness to Syrian refugees living in camps in Jordan

- Has volunteered for children's hospitals in LA for over a decade 

- Donated millions of her divorce settlement to the ACLU and the LA Children's Hospital 

- Is a women's rights ambassador for the ACLU, and a Human Rights Champion for the United Nations

- Supporter of Born This Way Foundation, GLAAD, Habitat for Humanity, The Trevor Project, RiseNowUS, Sam's USA, Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, SHIELD Act, Center for Inquiry, World Identity Network, Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights, and Human Rights Campaign

- Spoke at global events like the UN Social Good Summit, Global Citizen Festival, One Young World Conference, L'Oreal Women of Worth, and Emery Awards Gala

Amber has been an advocate for others, but it's time that people be advocates for her.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.

Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.

Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

Amber Heard won and is innocent... UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

- UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).

- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.

Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

Amber Heard won and is innocent... UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

According to an anonymous source saying she was the partner of ex-JD staff on social media March 29 to April 2019: Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights.

Staff knew and saw that she was injured by Depp... When the source contacted us knowing she was abused, and showed us a missing person's photo of someone who was going to testify against JD, it made it our responsibility to try to help Amber Heard...

Our petition was encouraged by The Geek Buzz, a supporter of the 1938 comic issue of Superman stopping domestic violence. 

We hope for Amber's success in life long-term and thank her for her causes! It's changed lives for the better.
It's an assault against all women to silence Amber or other victims for speaking out against violence either in spoken words or Op-Eds.

The enabling culture of abuse that she spoke against in her Washington Post December 2018 Op-ed article is exactly what's being created after she wrote it by not allowing her to have support publicly or online by preventing progress.

We care and we want leaders like Amber Heard who advocate for equality!
It doesn't matter to these others how much philanthropy or good work she does - she's never perfect enough to them.

Amber Heard - Long-Time Charity, Philanthropy, and Activism:

- Started volunteering at age 12 and spent mornings at an Austin Soup Kitchen

Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>

IO Tillett witnessed Amber's blood on a pillow and saw her injuries after Amber woke up from a violent fight that nearly suffocated her. IO was the first to call 911 to protect Amber from her husband: <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html</a>

According to an anonymous source saying she was the partner of ex-JD staff on social media March 29 to April 2019: Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots: google folder and video.

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.
Staff knew and saw that she was injured by Depp... When the source contacted us knowing she was abused, and showed us a missing person's photo of someone who was going to testify against JD, it made it our responsibility to try to help Amber Heard...

Our petition was encouraged by The Geek Buzz, a supporter of the 1938 comic issue of Superman stopping domestic violence. 

We hope for Amber's success in life long-term and thank her for her causes! It's changed lives for the better.
It's an assault against all women to silence Amber or other victims for speaking out against violence either in spoken words or Op-Eds.

The enabling culture of abuse that she spoke against in her Washington Post December 2018 Op-ed article is exactly what's being created after she wrote it by not allowing her to have support publicly or online by preventing progress.

We care and we want leaders like Amber Heard who advocate for equality!
It doesn't matter to these others how much philanthropy or good work she does - she's never perfect enough to them.

Amber Heard - Long-Time Charity, Philanthropy, and Activism:

- Started volunteering at age 12 and spent mornings at an Austin Soup Kitchen

Amber Heard won and is innocent... UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

- UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.

Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims.

Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

She has extensive evidence supporting her:

UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).
Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>
Her detailed statements and citations of evidence, including her injuries, in UK's July 2020 NGN Trial: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7. 
NGN's evidence in closing submissions for the UK Trial.
Videos of ""Amber Heard Is Innocent"": Video One, Video Two, and Video Three on our Channel. Also, her side of Audio Two where she feared for her life.
See over 16 Videos, including Audio which was cut out of leaks, on Incredibly Incredible's Channel such as JD telling Amber to write to him every morning to tell him to not hurt her and text messages... 
IO Tillett witnessed Amber's blood on a pillow and saw her injuries after Amber woke up from a violent fight that nearly suffocated her. IO was the first to call 911 to protect Amber from her husband: <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html</a>

According to an anonymous source saying she was the partner of ex-JD staff on social media March 29 to April 2019: Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots: google folder and video.

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.
Staff knew and saw that she was injured by Depp... When the source contacted us knowing she was abused, and showed us a missing person's photo of someone who was going to testify against JD, it made it our responsibility to try to help Amber Heard...

Our petition was encouraged by The Geek Buzz, a supporter of the 1938 comic issue of Superman stopping domestic violence. 

We hope for Amber's success in life long-term and thank her for her causes! It's changed lives for the better.
It's an assault against all women to silence Amber or other victims for speaking out against violence either in spoken words or Op-Eds.

The enabling culture of abuse that she spoke against in her Washington Post December 2018 Op-ed article is exactly what's being created after she wrote it by not allowing her to have support publicly or online by preventing progress.

We care and we want leaders like Amber Heard who advocate for equality!
It doesn't matter to these others how much philanthropy or good work she does - she's never perfect enough to them.

Amber Heard - Long-Time Charity, Philanthropy, and Activism:

- Started volunteering at age 12 and spent mornings at an Austin Soup Kitchen

- At age 16, took a stand against her school prom denying a same-sex couple entry by appealing to the ACLU

- Has worked with the Art of Elysium since its inception, a charity that brings the arts into the lives of seriously ill children

- Has traveled on Amnesty International research missions to the Mexico border, and brought awareness to Syrian refugees living in camps in Jordan

- Has volunteered for children's hospitals in LA for over a decade 

- Donated millions of her divorce settlement to the ACLU and the LA Children's Hospital 

- Is a women's rights ambassador for the ACLU, and a Human Rights Champion for the United Nations

- Supporter of Born This Way Foundation, GLAAD, Habitat for Humanity, The Trevor Project, RiseNowUS, Sam's USA, Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, SHIELD Act, Center for Inquiry, World Identity Network, Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights, and Human Rights Campaign

- Spoke at global events like the UN Social Good Summit, Global Citizen Festival, One Young World Conference, L'Oreal Women of Worth, and Emery Awards Gala

Amber has been an advocate for others, but it's time that people be advocates for her.

Amber Heard won and is innocent... UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.

Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims.

Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

She has extensive evidence supporting her:

UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).
Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>

See over 16 Videos, including Audio which was cut out of leaks, on Incredibly Incredible's Channel such as JD telling Amber to write to him every morning to tell him to not hurt her and text messages... 
IO Tillett witnessed Amber's blood on a pillow and saw her injuries after Amber woke up from a violent fight that nearly suffocated her. IO was the first to call 911 to protect Amber from her husband: <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html</a>

According to an anonymous source saying she was the partner of ex-JD staff on social media March 29 to April 2019: Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots: google folder and video.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.
Staff knew and saw that she was injured by Depp... When the source contacted us knowing she was abused, and showed us a missing person's photo of someone who was going to testify against JD, it made it our responsibility to try to help Amber Heard...

Our petition was encouraged by The Geek Buzz, a supporter of the 1938 comic issue of Superman stopping domestic violence. 

We hope for Amber's success in life long-term and thank her for her causes! It's changed lives for the better.
It's an assault against all women to silence Amber or other victims for speaking out against violence either in spoken words or Op-Eds.

The enabling culture of abuse that she spoke against in her Washington Post December 2018 Op-ed article is exactly what's being created after she wrote it by not allowing her to have support publicly or online by preventing progress.

We care and we want leaders like Amber Heard who advocate for equality!
It doesn't matter to these others how much philanthropy or good work she does - she's never perfect enough to them.

Amber Heard - Long-Time Charity, Philanthropy, and Activism:

- Started volunteering at age 12 and spent mornings at an Austin Soup Kitchen

- At age 16, took a stand against her school prom denying a same-sex couple entry by appealing to the ACLU

- Has worked with the Art of Elysium since its inception, a charity that brings the arts into the lives of seriously ill children

- Has traveled on Amnesty International research missions to the Mexico border, and brought awareness to Syrian refugees living in camps in Jordan

- Has volunteered for children's hospitals in LA for over a decade 

- Donated millions of her divorce settlement to the ACLU and the LA Children's Hospital 

- Is a women's rights ambassador for the ACLU, and a Human Rights Champion for the United Nations

- Supporter of Born This Way Foundation, GLAAD, Habitat for Humanity, The Trevor Project, RiseNowUS, Sam's USA, Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, SHIELD Act, Center for Inquiry, World Identity Network, Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights, and Human Rights Campaign

- Spoke at global events like the UN Social Good Summit, Global Citizen Festival, One Young World Conference, L'Oreal Women of Worth, and Emery Awards Gala

Amber has been an advocate for others, but it's time that people be advocates for her.
To prevent domestic abuse - GET INVOLVED!

I will personally explain what she tried to extort and paste the links, because you're a lazy S.O.B . 

She tried to get a Land Rover, three of his penthouses, 125k for legal fees and $50k a month payments until death. This can be found here: https://twitter.com/ifod_net/status/1025299758536110080?s=19

The donations she promised to charity which I will quote from Amber Heard: 
""As reported in the media, the amount received in the divorce was $7 million and $7 million is being donated. This is over and above any funds that I have given away in the past and will continue to give away in the future."" Link found here: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/johnny-depp-amber-heard-divorce-read-statement-full-settlement-charity-donation-a7198621.html

The Judge has now asked for receipts which Amber has tried to quash in court several times. Anyone who has donated, would be happy to hand those over, but not Amber, because she did not donate it. Request for receipts found here :https://twitter.com/LauraBockov/status/1340403775215988736?s=09

Information from the charity's website with a list of lifetime donors, which states she has not donated the money: https://twitter.com/RubiksGlass/status/1327389636184973314?s=19

Any further questions, or does this clear up the fact that Amber was only in it for the money? I have much more evidence through testimony and facts, that back up her need for money, so don't waste my time.",,6.0,,,,6.0,,,,,reddit

Amber Heard won and is innocent... UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.
Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.
Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.

Amber Heard won and is innocent... UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.
Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.
Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

Amber Heard won and is innocent... UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.

“I accept that Mr. Depp put her in fear of her life,” a British judge wrote, dismissing the actor’s libel case on Monday...

Johnny Depp on Monday lost his court case against a British newspaper that called him a “wife beater” and claimed there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had assaulted the actress Amber Heard repeatedly during their marriage.

Mr. Depp’s assaults included head-butting Ms. Heard, repeatedly hitting her and tearing out clumps of her hair, wrote Andrew Nicol, the British judge who heard the case, in a ruling issued online on Monday. In dismissing the case, he said the defendants had shown that what they published was “substantially true.”

The assaults “must have been terrifying,” the judge wrote regarding incidents in March 2015 in Australia, in which Ms. Heard said that Mr. Depp assaulted her several times, including smashing a telephone beside her face. “I accept that Mr. Depp put her in fear of her life,” the judge wrote.

The judge also acknowledged the risk Ms. Heard had taken in speaking up about the violence. “I also accept that Ms. Heard’s allegations have had a negative effect on her career as an actor and activist,” he said.

Women’s rights groups in Britain praised the decision. “This is an important ruling and one which we hope sends a very powerful message: Every single survivor of domestic abuse should be listened to and should be heard,” Lisa King, a spokeswoman for Refuge, a British charity for survivors of domestic violence, said in a statement...

The article [from NGN] called Mr. Depp a “wife beater” and urged the author J.K. Rowling to intervene and have Mr. Depp removed from the “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” movie series, based on her book.

The newspaper’s legal team argued that the accusations in the article were “accurate and true.” Ms. Heard, 34, testified on the newspaper’s behalf and said in pretrial documents that Mr. Depp had assaulted her on 14 occasions during their relationship starting before they were married. Mr. Depp denied all of the claims, but the judge found that most of them did occur, citing a range of text messages from Mr. Depp among the evidence....

After the ruling was issued on Monday, The Sun said in a statement, “Domestic abuse victims must never be silenced, and we thank the judge for his careful consideration and thank Amber Heard for her courage in giving evidence to the court.”

Jennifer Robinson, a lawyer for Ms. Heard, said the actress was “unable to comment on the case due to the ongoing U.S. proceedings.” But Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, Ms. Heard’s American lawyer, said in a statement that the judgment was “not a surprise.”

“We are committed to obtaining justice for Amber Heard in the U.S. Court and defending Ms. Heard’s right to free speech,” Ms. Bredehoft said.""

From The Guardian: 

How Amber Heard stood alone against a Hollywood superstar

Unlike him, however, she was given a police escort because of threats from Depp’s fans...

In 12 out of the 14 incidents of assault reported by Heard in open court, the judge said he found the allegations proved on the balance of probabilities...

More seriously – say sources close to Heard – both she and her sister Whitney have received anonymous death threats. Harassing messages were also sent to the chambers of Jennifer Robinson, the human rights lawyer whose clients include Julian Assange and who attended court with Heard, alongside Heard’s partner, Bianca Butti, and a US attorney, Elaine Bredehoft.

Other voices, while not aligned specifically with Heard, had spoken up outside of court, such as the Labour frontbench MP Jess Phillips, who voiced concern about what she had read in coverage “that seems to be a character assassination of Heard, leaning too far, in my opinion, towards the old tropes about domestic abuse that campaigners like me have tried for years to combat...”",5.0,5.0,change_petition_comments_dec_5,,,,,,,,change

Amber Heard won and is innocent... UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).
Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>

 IO Tillett witnessed Amber's blood on a pillow and saw her injuries after Amber woke up from a violent fight that nearly suffocated her. IO was the first to call 911 to protect Amber from her husband: <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html</a>
Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.
Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

“I accept that Mr. Depp put her in fear of her life,” a British judge wrote, dismissing the actor’s libel case on Monday...

Johnny Depp on Monday lost his court case against a British newspaper that called him a “wife beater” and claimed there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had assaulted the actress Amber Heard repeatedly during their marriage.

Mr. Depp’s assaults included head-butting Ms. Heard, repeatedly hitting her and tearing out clumps of her hair, wrote Andrew Nicol, the British judge who heard the case, in a ruling issued online on Monday. In dismissing the case, he said the defendants had shown that what they published was “substantially true.”

The assaults “must have been terrifying,” the judge wrote regarding incidents in March 2015 in Australia, in which Ms. Heard said that Mr. Depp assaulted her several times, including smashing a telephone beside her face. “I accept that Mr. Depp put her in fear of her life,” the judge wrote.

The judge also acknowledged the risk Ms. Heard had taken in speaking up about the violence. “I also accept that Ms. Heard’s allegations have had a negative effect on her career as an actor and activist,” he said.

Women’s rights groups in Britain praised the decision. “This is an important ruling and one which we hope sends a very powerful message: Every single survivor of domestic abuse should be listened to and should be heard,” Lisa King, a spokeswoman for Refuge, a British charity for survivors of domestic violence, said in a statement...

The article [from NGN] called Mr. Depp a “wife beater” and urged the author J.K. Rowling to intervene and have Mr. Depp removed from the “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” movie series, based on her book.

The newspaper’s legal team argued that the accusations in the article were “accurate and true.” Ms. Heard, 34, testified on the newspaper’s behalf and said in pretrial documents that Mr. Depp had assaulted her on 14 occasions during their relationship starting before they were married. Mr. Depp denied all of the claims, but the judge found that most of them did occur, citing a range of text messages from Mr. Depp among the evidence....

After the ruling was issued on Monday, The Sun said in a statement, “Domestic abuse victims must never be silenced, and we thank the judge for his careful consideration and thank Amber Heard for her courage in giving evidence to the court.”

Jennifer Robinson, a lawyer for Ms. Heard, said the actress was “unable to comment on the case due to the ongoing U.S. proceedings.” But Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, Ms. Heard’s American lawyer, said in a statement that the judgment was “not a surprise.”

“We are committed to obtaining justice for Amber Heard in the U.S. Court and defending Ms. Heard’s right to free speech,” Ms. Bredehoft said.""

From The Guardian: 

How Amber Heard stood alone against a Hollywood superstar

Unlike him, however, she was given a police escort because of threats from Depp’s fans...

In 12 out of the 14 incidents of assault reported by Heard in open court, the judge said he found the allegations proved on the balance of probabilities...

More seriously – say sources close to Heard – both she and her sister Whitney have received anonymous death threats. Harassing messages were also sent to the chambers of Jennifer Robinson, the human rights lawyer whose clients include Julian Assange and who attended court with Heard, alongside Heard’s partner, Bianca Butti, and a US attorney, Elaine Bredehoft.

Other voices, while not aligned specifically with Heard, had spoken up outside of court, such as the Labour frontbench MP Jess Phillips, who voiced concern about what she had read in coverage “that seems to be a character assassination of Heard, leaning too far, in my opinion, towards the old tropes about domestic abuse that campaigners like me have tried for years to combat...”",5.0,5.0,change_petition_comments_dec_5,,,,,,,,change

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.
Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.
Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

""We Support Amber Heard in Aquaman 2, Her Life, and Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/we-support-amber-heard-in-aquaman-2-her-life-and-public-safety-to-save-lives"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.change.org/p/we-support-amber-heard-in-aquaman-2-her-life-and-public-safety-to-save-lives</a>

 

On November 6, 2020, her abusive ex husband, Depp, was removed from his role by Warner Bros Studios.

Amber is still in Aquaman 2, spokesperson for L'Oreal, and involved with nonprofits, and we support this.

We support businesses that help women who are domestically abused. 

You Should Support Amber Heard in Aquaman, L'Oreal, the United Nations, and ACLU.

Don't let hate groups on the internet dictate what should happen...",5.0,5.0,change_petition_comments_dec_4,,,,,,,,change

The sun (and the person that wrote it) didn't even appear as a witness in the case. It was her in court as a witness saying he'd abused her. That's the case to defend the sun. Her testimony.
Regardless of what she did to him, the judge believed her that he'd hit her.

Basically the whole thing seems to be that they had a fucked up relationship (and that's giving her the benefit of the doubt). It *seems* she was indeed the abuser (actual evidence for this include recordings of her hitting him and saying nobody would believe him, him needing surgery after having glass thrown at him, her shitting in his bed and other incidents) but he physically retaliated at times (haven't seen any actual proof of this even quoted but apparently happened on a few occasions).

Now back to the point. This post is here because she's now trying to represent VICTIMS of abuse. That is seriously fucked up and people have a right to be angry. That's what the post is about.
Looks like she was right when she told him that nobody would believe him.

Amber is not only powerful as Mera, but she is also an activist for human rights.

She was the first American actress to be named Human Rights Champion to the United Nations Human Rights Office.

She's an ambassador for the ACLU, donor to Women's Rights Groups, protector of refugees, and does charity. She has spent years helping children.

She's an inner philanthropist and advocate who should have a voice.

We want to see her in more films, movies, shows, modeling, and work in the entertainment industry. We want to see more equal rights advocacy!

She's a positive influence on us and we should see more of her!

We want powerful women who can be respected and treated equally.

We created this petition because we support women who have been domestically abused and we would prevent violence against women. We want her humanitarian work and leadership to continue... Would you stand up to prevent or stop domestic abuse? The social question is also: ""Would you save her?""

We support Amber Heard's life and her humanitarian work...

Amber Heard was domestically abused by her ex-husband and is still abused by Johnny Depp and his followers with coercive control, threats, incited hate, financially, emotionally, and online daily. We would rather not refer to him, but we need to support women who go against powerful people and believe the victims.

Amber Heard wrote in the Washington Post, as an Ambassador for the ACLU, about how she had to change her phone number weekly due to death threats from Depp fans and how she supports rights: ""Amber Heard: I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change."" 

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman. We should be able to speak out to create change.

We can change culture to improve lives...

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims.

Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

She has extensive evidence supporting her:

UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).

Amber is not only powerful as Mera, but she is also an activist for human rights.

She was the first American actress to be named Human Rights Champion to the United Nations Human Rights Office.

She's an ambassador for the ACLU, donor to Women's Rights Groups, protector of refugees, and does charity. She has spent years helping children.

She's an inner philanthropist and advocate who should have a voice.

Amber Heard was domestically abused by her ex-husband and is still abused by Johnny Depp and his followers with coercive control, threats, incited hate, financially, emotionally, and online daily. We would rather not refer to him, but we need to support women who go against powerful people and believe the victims.

Amber Heard wrote in the Washington Post, as an Ambassador for the ACLU, about how she had to change her phone number weekly due to death threats from Depp fans and how she supports rights: ""Amber Heard: I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change."" 

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman. We should be able to speak out to create change.

We can change culture to improve lives...

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html,26130632,"Amber Heard inspires us!  We support her life, her role in Aquaman 2, her humanitarian work, and any work she has. We support her evidence and public safety to save lives.

Amber is not only powerful as Mera, but she is also an activist for human rights.

She was the first American actress to be named Human Rights Champion to the United Nations Human Rights Office.

She's an ambassador for the ACLU, donor to Women's Rights Groups, protector of refugees, and does charity. She has spent years helping children.

She's an inner philanthropist and advocate who should have a voice.

We want to see her in more films, movies, shows, modeling, and work in the entertainment industry. We want to see more equal rights advocacy!

She's a positive influence on us and we should see more of her!

We want powerful women who can be respected and treated equally.

We created this petition because we support women who have been domestically abused and we would prevent violence against women. We want her humanitarian work and leadership to continue... Would you stand up to prevent or stop domestic abuse? The social question is also: ""Would you save her?""

We support Amber Heard's life and her humanitarian work...

Amber Heard was domestically abused by her ex-husband and is still abused by Johnny Depp and his followers with coercive control, threats, incited hate, financially, emotionally, and online daily. We would rather not refer to him, but we need to support women who go against powerful people and believe the victims.

Amber Heard wrote in the Washington Post, as an Ambassador for the ACLU, about how she had to change her phone number weekly due to death threats from Depp fans and how she supports rights: ""Amber Heard: I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change."" 

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman. We should be able to speak out to create change.

We can change culture to improve lives...

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims.

Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

She has extensive evidence supporting her:

UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).
Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>
Her detailed statements and citations of evidence, including her injuries, in UK's July 2020 NGN Trial: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7. 
NGN's evidence in closing submissions for the UK Trial.
Videos of ""Amber Heard Is Innocent"": Video One, Video Two, and Video Three on our Channel. Also, her side of Audio Two where she feared for her life.
See over 16 Videos, including Audio which was cut out of leaks, on Incredibly Incredible's Channel such as JD telling Amber to write to him every morning to tell him to not hurt her and text messages... 
IO Tillett witnessed Amber's blood on a pillow and saw her injuries after Amber woke up from a violent fight that nearly suffocated her. IO was the first to call 911 to protect Amber from her husband: <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html</a>

According to an anonymous source saying she was the partner of ex-JD staff on social media March 29 to April 2019: Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots: google folder and video.

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.
Staff knew and saw that she was injured by Depp... When the source contacted us knowing she was abused, and showed us a missing person's photo of someone who was going to testify against JD, it made it our responsibility to try to help Amber Heard...",4.0,4.0,change_petition_comments_dec_6,,,,,,,,change

The sun (and the person that wrote it) didn't even appear as a witness in the case. It was her in court as a witness saying he'd abused her. That's the case to defend the sun. Her testimony.
Regardless of what she did to him, the judge believed her that he'd hit her.

Basically the whole thing seems to be that they had a fucked up relationship (and that's giving her the benefit of the doubt). It *seems* she was indeed the abuser (actual evidence for this include recordings of her hitting him and saying nobody would believe him, him needing surgery after having glass thrown at him, her shitting in his bed and other incidents) but he physically retaliated at times (haven't seen any actual proof of this even quoted but apparently happened on a few occasions).

Now back to the point. This post is here because she's now trying to represent VICTIMS of abuse. That is seriously fucked up and people have a right to be angry. That's what the post is about.
Looks like she was right when she told him that nobody would believe him.

However when the police were called to the scene over a domestic call they found no evidence of any physical injuries after examining her. I do not know though if these were the same text messages used in the court case with the Sun tabloid defending their use of the term wife beater or a different set of texts sent between them. 

However she’s fabricated so much evidence and made so many claims, I can see why people are skeptical of her claims, and also why they’ll be appealing the verdict. Her also being arrested for physically abusing a previous partner prior to this whole shitshow with Johnny Depp is also concerning.

Apparently Amber also accused Depp of the assault during the texts in question and shared multiple photos of herself with visible injuries after requesting a restraining order. However when the police were called to the scene over a domestic call they found no evidence of any physical injuries after examining her. I do not know though if these were the same text messages used in the court case with the Sun tabloid defending their use of the term wife beater or a different set of texts sent between them. 

However she’s fabricated so much evidence and made so many claims, I can see why people are skeptical of her claims, and also why they’ll be appealing the verdict. Her also being arrested for physically abusing a previous partner prior to this whole shitshow with Johnny Depp is also concerning.

Heard says, “You didn’t get punched. You got hit. I’m sorry I hit you like this. But I did not punch you. I did not fing deck you. I fing was hitting you.

Amber Heard won and is innocent... UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

- UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).
- Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>
- Her detailed statements and citations of evidence, including her injuries, in UK's July 2020 NGN Trial: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7. 
- NGN's evidence in closing submissions for the UK Trial.
- Videos of ""Amber Heard Is Innocent"": Video One, Video Two, and Video Three on our Channel. - Also, her side of Audio Two where she feared for her life.

IO was the first to call 911 to protect Amber from her husband: <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html</a>

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.

Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

According to an anonymous source saying she was the partner of ex-JD staff on social media March 29 to April 2019: Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots: google folder and video.

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.
Staff knew and saw that she was injured by Depp... When the source contacted us knowing she was abused, and showed us a missing person's photo of someone who was going to testify against JD, it made it our responsibility to try to help Amber Heard...

Our petition was encouraged by The Geek Buzz, a supporter of the 1938 comic issue of Superman stopping domestic violence. 

We hope for Amber's success in life long-term and thank her for her causes! It's changed lives for the better.
It's an assault against all women to silence Amber or other victims for speaking out against violence either in spoken words or Op-Eds.

The enabling culture of abuse that she spoke against in her Washington Post December 2018 Op-ed article is exactly what's being created after she wrote it by not allowing her to have support publicly or online by preventing progress.

We care and we want leaders like Amber Heard who advocate for equality!
It doesn't matter to these others how much philanthropy or good work she does - she's never perfect enough to them.

- Has traveled on Amnesty International research missions to the Mexico border, and brought awareness to Syrian refugees living in camps in Jordan

- Has volunteered for children's hospitals in LA for over a decade 

- Donated millions of her divorce settlement to the ACLU and the LA Children's Hospital 

- Is a women's rights ambassador for the ACLU, and a Human Rights Champion for the United Nations

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

- UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).
- Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>
- Her detailed statements and citations of evidence, including her injuries, in UK's July 2020 NGN Trial: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7. 
- NGN's evidence in closing submissions for the UK Trial.
- Videos of ""Amber Heard Is Innocent"": Video One, Video Two, and Video Three on our Channel. - Also, her side of Audio Two where she feared for her life.
- See over 16 Videos, including Audio which was cut out of leaks, on Incredibly Incredible's Channel such as JD telling Amber to write to him every morning to tell him to not hurt her and text messages... <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg</a>

- IO Tillett witnessed Amber's blood on a pillow and saw her injuries after Amber woke up from a violent fight that nearly suffocated her. IO was the first to call 911 to protect Amber from her husband: <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html</a>

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.

Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.

Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

Amber Heard won and is innocent... UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

- UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.

According to an anonymous source saying she was the partner of ex-JD staff on social media March 29 to April 2019: Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots: google folder and video.

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.
Staff knew and saw that she was injured by Depp... When the source contacted us knowing she was abused, and showed us a missing person's photo of someone who was going to testify against JD, it made it our responsibility to try to help Amber Heard...

We hope for Amber's success in life long-term and thank her for her causes! It's changed lives for the better.
It's an assault against all women to silence Amber or other victims for speaking out against violence either in spoken words or Op-Eds.

The enabling culture of abuse that she spoke against in her Washington Post December 2018 Op-ed article is exactly what's being created after she wrote it by not allowing her to have support publicly or online by preventing progress.

We care and we want leaders like Amber Heard who advocate for equality!
It doesn't matter to these others how much philanthropy or good work she does - she's never perfect enough to them.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims.

Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

She has extensive evidence supporting her:

UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.

Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

Amber Heard won and is innocent... UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

- UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).
- Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>
- Her detailed statements and citations of evidence, including her injuries, in UK's July 2020 NGN Trial: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7. 
- NGN's evidence in closing submissions for the UK Trial.
- Videos of ""Amber Heard Is Innocent"": Video One, Video Two, and Video Three on our Channel. - Also, her side of Audio Two where she feared for her life.
- See over 16 Videos, including Audio which was cut out of leaks, on Incredibly Incredible's Channel such as JD telling Amber to write to him every morning to tell him to not hurt her and text messages... <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg</a>

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.

Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

Amber Heard won and is innocent... UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

- UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).
- Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>
- Her detailed statements and citations of evidence, including her injuries, in UK's July 2020 NGN Trial: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7. 
- NGN's evidence in closing submissions for the UK Trial.
- Videos of ""Amber Heard Is Innocent"": Video One, Video Two, and Video Three on our Channel. - Also, her side of Audio Two where she feared for her life.
- See over 16 Videos, including Audio which was cut out of leaks, on Incredibly Incredible's Channel such as JD telling Amber to write to him every morning to tell him to not hurt her and text messages... <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg</a>

- IO Tillett witnessed Amber's blood on a pillow and saw her injuries after Amber woke up from a violent fight that nearly suffocated her. IO was the first to call 911 to protect Amber from her husband: <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html</a>

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.

Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

On November 6, 2020, her abusive ex husband, Depp, was removed from his role by Warner Bros Studios.

Amber is still in Aquaman 2, spokesperson for L'Oreal, and involved with nonprofits, and we support this.

We support businesses that help women who are domestically abused. 

You Should Support Amber Heard in Aquaman, L'Oreal, the United Nations, and ACLU.

It's an assault against all women to silence Amber or other victims for speaking out against violence either in spoken words or Op-Eds.

The enabling culture of abuse that she spoke against in her Washington Post December 2018 Op-ed article is exactly what's being created after she wrote it by not allowing her to have support publicly or online by preventing progress.

We care and we want leaders like Amber Heard who advocate for equality!
It doesn't matter to these others how much philanthropy or good work she does - she's never perfect enough to them.

IO was the first to call 911 to protect Amber from her husband: <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html</a>

According to an anonymous source saying she was the partner of ex-JD staff on social media March 29 to April 2019: Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots: google folder and video.

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.
Staff knew and saw that she was injured by Depp... When the source contacted us knowing she was abused, and showed us a missing person's photo of someone who was going to testify against JD, it made it our responsibility to try to help Amber Heard...

Our petition was encouraged by The Geek Buzz, a supporter of the 1938 comic issue of Superman stopping domestic violence. 

We hope for Amber's success in life long-term and thank her for her causes! It's changed lives for the better.
It's an assault against all women to silence Amber or other victims for speaking out against violence either in spoken words or Op-Eds.

The enabling culture of abuse that she spoke against in her Washington Post December 2018 Op-ed article is exactly what's being created after she wrote it by not allowing her to have support publicly or online by preventing progress.

We care and we want leaders like Amber Heard who advocate for equality!
It doesn't matter to these others how much philanthropy or good work she does - she's never perfect enough to them.

Amber Heard - Long-Time Charity, Philanthropy, and Activism:

- Started volunteering at age 12 and spent mornings at an Austin Soup Kitchen

Amber Heard won and is innocent... UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

- UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.

Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

Amber Heard won and is innocent... UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

- UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).
- Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>
- Her detailed statements and citations of evidence, including her injuries, in UK's July 2020 NGN Trial: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7. 
- NGN's evidence in closing submissions for the UK Trial.
- Videos of ""Amber Heard Is Innocent"": Video One, Video Two, and Video Three on our Channel. - Also, her side of Audio Two where she feared for her life.
- See over 16 Videos, including Audio which was cut out of leaks, on Incredibly Incredible's Channel such as JD telling Amber to write to him every morning to tell him to not hurt her and text messages... <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKNc-woAlnxt0H-yJ8RXJg</a>

IO was the first to call 911 to protect Amber from her husband: <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html</a>

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.

Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

She has extensive evidence supporting her:

UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).
Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>

According to an anonymous source saying she was the partner of ex-JD staff on social media March 29 to April 2019: Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots: google folder and video.

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.
Staff knew and saw that she was injured by Depp... When the source contacted us knowing she was abused, and showed us a missing person's photo of someone who was going to testify against JD, it made it our responsibility to try to help Amber Heard...

Our petition was encouraged by The Geek Buzz, a supporter of the 1938 comic issue of Superman stopping domestic violence. 

We hope for Amber's success in life long-term and thank her for her causes! It's changed lives for the better.
It's an assault against all women to silence Amber or other victims for speaking out against violence either in spoken words or Op-Eds.

The enabling culture of abuse that she spoke against in her Washington Post December 2018 Op-ed article is exactly what's being created after she wrote it by not allowing her to have support publicly or online by preventing progress.

We care and we want leaders like Amber Heard who advocate for equality!
It doesn't matter to these others how much philanthropy or good work she does - she's never perfect enough to them.

Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

She has extensive evidence supporting her:

UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).
Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>
Her detailed statements and citations of evidence, including her injuries, in UK's July 2020 NGN Trial: Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7. 
NGN's evidence in closing submissions for the UK Trial.
Videos of ""Amber Heard Is Innocent"": Video One, Video Two, and Video Three on our Channel. Also, her side of Audio Two where she feared for her life.
See over 16 Videos, including Audio which was cut out of leaks, on Incredibly Incredible's Channel such as JD telling Amber to write to him every morning to tell him to not hurt her and text messages... 
IO Tillett witnessed Amber's blood on a pillow and saw her injuries after Amber woke up from a violent fight that nearly suffocated her. IO was the first to call 911 to protect Amber from her husband: <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-amber-heard-io-tillett-911-call-20160608-snap-story.html</a>

According to an anonymous source saying she was the partner of ex-JD staff on social media March 29 to April 2019: Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots: google folder and video.

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.
Staff knew and saw that she was injured by Depp... When the source contacted us knowing she was abused, and showed us a missing person's photo of someone who was going to testify against JD, it made it our responsibility to try to help Amber Heard...

Our petition was encouraged by The Geek Buzz, a supporter of the 1938 comic issue of Superman stopping domestic violence. 

We hope for Amber's success in life long-term and thank her for her causes! It's changed lives for the better.
It's an assault against all women to silence Amber or other victims for speaking out against violence either in spoken words or Op-Eds.

The enabling culture of abuse that she spoke against in her Washington Post December 2018 Op-ed article is exactly what's being created after she wrote it by not allowing her to have support publicly or online by preventing progress.

We care and we want leaders like Amber Heard who advocate for equality!
It doesn't matter to these others how much philanthropy or good work she does - she's never perfect enough to them.
