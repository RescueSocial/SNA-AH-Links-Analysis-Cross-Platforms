* He shows up late to set, often drunk and/or on drugs.
* He insists on wearing an earpiece because he refuses to learn lines.

https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/hes-radioactive-inside-johnny-depps-self-made-implosion,t1_gf6ixmn,"Depp likely wasn't dropped because of the domestic abuse drama. The only reason a huge, multimillionaire star and lead actor in a major movie franchise would get dropped in Hollywood is if they couldn't insure him any more. And a lot of the reasons why a person would be deemed too costly to insure would be drug/alcohol addiction, particularly of the variety that makes a person unable to work in a reliable fashion, especially in an industry like Hollywood, where time is fucking everything. Johnny Depp has been late, holding up shooting, and a lot of the time, refuses to show up for commitments he promises he'd show up for. If you don't fucking show up for work, you'll get fired.

But even that could be excusable, provided he had a team who could get him to where he needs to be on time, or if there are people in the industry who are powerful enough and capable enough to vouch for him, in spite of all that. Except Johnny Depp has been spending the better part of the last few years burning bridges with anyone who could bother to defend him. [This article says it all:](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/hes-radioactive-inside-johnny-depps-self-made-implosion)

>""One studio executive who has worked with Depp in recent years says  his inner demons had long ago bled into his professional life, making  him ""a huge liability"" thanks to frequent tardiness and costly behavior,  all cataloged in the U.K. suit.  
>  
>""The discovery that came out in that trial alone would be enough to scare any studio,"" says the executive."" 

And he has a shitty team of professionals to run his life:

>To many observers, Depp's negative press was largely avoidable and  stemmed from his aggressive legal tactics. The chief architect behind  Depp's sue-'em-all strategy is Adam Waldman, a handsome Washington  lawyer with his own sheen of controversy given a clientele that has  included Russian oligarchs and Julian Assange. Waldman, who is married  to Berlin-based jet-setter and luxury skin-care entrepreneur Barbara  Sturm, conducts himself in an unorthodox manner, mocking his legal  opponents on Twitter. Sources say Depp met Waldman through Saudi Arabian  Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the country's powerful minister of energy,  in summer 2016. (Depp spent time aboard the prince's megayacht in the  past.)

And this was after he fired his agent of three decades, sued his long term business manager, and also sued his entertainment lawyer and supposed ""father figure."" 

Not only that, but because he's proceeding with the legal actions against Heard in America now, there's a chance he'll be asked to air not just his dirty laundry, but that of other people as well. So he's been burning down bridges and pissing on the ashes as well, and he has surrounded himself by some of the worst people to be with right now. None of this leaves studio execs much room for optimism.",22,22

So to frame any domestic violence situation as simply women provoking men into beating them is a terribly inaccurate take on the situation. 

When it comes to reciprocal violence unless you reach self defence levels then 'what if Depp provoked Heards  agggression' is not really a valid question. Would me saying what did Heard do to provoke Depps aggression be a fair question to ask?! What level of provocation is acceptable? If he insults her does he deserve to get a slap? 

As to your last point I don't know enough about the details to say if the level of response was appropriate. But I have heard she chopped off a chunk of his finger so I would say at that stage pretty much any non lethal violence is a fair and appropriate level of self defence.",7,7

Those online petitions may accomplish little, but well over a *million* people signed one against her (and that was just one of several).

The sun (and the person that wrote it) didn't even appear as a witness in the case. It was her in court as a witness saying he'd abused her. That's the case to defend the sun. Her testimony.
Regardless of what she did to him, the judge believed her that he'd hit her.

Basically the whole thing seems to be that they had a fucked up relationship (and that's giving her the benefit of the doubt). It *seems* she was indeed the abuser (actual evidence for this include recordings of her hitting him and saying nobody would believe him, him needing surgery after having glass thrown at him, her shitting in his bed and other incidents) but he physically retaliated at times (haven't seen any actual proof of this even quoted but apparently happened on a few occasions).

Now back to the point. This post is here because she's now trying to represent VICTIMS of abuse. That is seriously fucked up and people have a right to be angry. That's what the post is about.
Looks like she was right when she told him that nobody would believe him.
