I will change the title to reflect that and add a note updating to my community tab as well.

This website is a joke of typos & grammatical errors, is full of ads, and offers ZERO links to proof of the firing. They say the ‚Äòprestigious Forbes magazine‚Äô has a quote about it, but doesn‚Äôt provide a link, *because they copy/pasted from another website*: IndieWire, which also isn't an original source!

Also, they spelled repercussions like this:

> but there were no reprocutions

For FUCKS SAKE, [here‚Äôs the Forbes article that mentions it *in passing* with ZERO FUCKING CONFIRMATION or interview discussion or fuck-all anything.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/keithflamer/2021/12/31/game-of-thrones-actress-emilia-clarke-sells-venice-california-home-for-44-million)

It‚Äôs an article about her selling her house, for God‚Äôs sake, and it came out IN DECEMBER OF 2020! Plus, IMDB still shows Heard as the character! IMDB knows their shit and is a verifiable source.

Look, I‚Äôd fucking LOVE to see Heard fired, but this fucking bullshit rumor mill has got to stop! Get a fucking real source AND a clue, OP /u/chiefsteward

She put in her witness statement in the UK trial - and also under oath that she had donated the full 7 million.... She's also on an interview on danish tv where she also stated that she had already donated the full 7 million, split between the ACLU and CHLA... The $100,000 donation was made by Johnny Depp on her behalf to both the ACLU and CHLA as they'd decided in the settlement. He was going to pay the full amount to the charities, she was the one who stopped him saying she wanted to donate it herself and then her lawyer sent him a letter demanding that Depp returns the $200,000 he donated of her money - $100,000 to both ACLU and CHLA.. All the information is out there - including the letter from the CHLA asking if she was going to fulfil her pledge to pay the money...   The interview where she states, she'd already donated the money, not that she was going to 'Eventually.'  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBH5O1ukpq8&feature=emb_logo",64.0,65.0,youtube_comments_4_months_24,,1.0,,,,,,youtube

Not only did she only bring up Bowie when he was back in the spotlight making Blackstar, 40-odd years after the event in question, but her claim that she lost her virginity to him instead of Page totally falls apart when you compare her statements to the tour dates and a calendar, which show that Bowie was nowhere near Mattix when she claims to have encountered him.

lol what?  There was an entire civil case.  [Here](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Depp_V_News_Group_Newspapers_Ltd_judgment.pdf) it is.

A judge found enough evidence to say that there were at least 12 incidents where Johnny beat her.  One of them is outlined below.  Depp was so drunk/high he didn't even remember kicking her until his manager told him how bad it was.  Then in the deposition he described that kick, which he didn't even remember based on the texts, as a ""playful tap"".

>According to the texts between Heard, Depp, and Depp‚Äôs assistant, Depp had blacked out and had no recollection of the kick. His assistant told him the next day. According to his assistant, Depp was ‚Äúappalled‚Äù and ‚Äúwhen I told him he kicked you, he cried‚Äù. The assistant went on to say, ‚Äúit was disgusting and he knows it‚Äù.

>Depp later texted Heard to apologize personally and promise it would never happen again.

>Depp also texted Paul Bettany discussing how how he went too far with drugs and alcohol on that flight and he needed to cut back. He had also texted Bettany about being in a rage and blacked out in a text that can be found here.

>Then, during the trial, Depp and the assistant changed their stories. They said that Depp hadn‚Äôt really hurt her, that it was a ‚Äúplayful tap‚Äù. He goes on to admit that he ‚Äúmay‚Äù have passed out in the bathroom on the trip, but denies blacking out. However, the language used in the original texts shows that it was obviously more sinister than that.",,28.0,,,,28.0,,,,,reddit

The Court heard from both parties, who were both represented by lawyers, and from third party witnesses (called by both sides), and reviewed other evidence such as photos and text message exchanges. And THEN made a finding about the 14 allegations of abuse. 

They found against Depp. They found that of the 14 allegations 12 were proven. 

If they really rubber stamped the decision Depp could have appealed it. To my knowledge he didn‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm not saying she‚Äôs innocent but he has been proven to be abusive. Read the judgment

Try to explain to them that many of their problems are caused by toxic masculinity, (which the right engages in far more willingly, especially the very people complaining about ""men's rights""), and many of them will retort with: ""What about toxic *femininity*""? Or somesuch nonsense.

Here's a screencap of something I saw a few days ago, to illustrate my point:

https://i.imgur.com/QX33B3h.png

To them, masculinity = good. Toxic is a word typically used to describe bad things. So if you use the term ""toxic masculinity"" you're calling masculinity bad, and because they believe they are masculine, you're calling *them bad*. It's all reptile brain shit, and they run with it.

https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/celebrity/johnny-depp-is-a-wife-beater-uk-judge-rules-in-libel-case,t3_lx2s7w,"‚ÄúJudge Andrew Nicol said he accepted claims from the actor‚Äôs former wife, actress Amber Heard, that he had violently assaulted her during their tempestuous five-year relationship.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have found that the great majority of alleged assaults of Ms Heard by Mr Depp have been proved to the civil standard,‚Äù said Nicol. ‚ÄúThe claimant has not succeeded in his action for libel.‚Äù

The judge ruled Depp's feelings towards his wife during their turbulent three-year relationship were summed up in a text where the actor revealed he had ""no mercy"" for her.

He also concluded Depp beat Ms Heard 12 times - starting in 2013 when he slapped the actress when she made a comment about his tattoo.

Over the course of their stormy marriage, the judge found Depp battered his wife after flying into drug and booze-fuelled rages.

But he dismissed two allegations made by Ms Heard in 2014 and 2015.

Reiterating the first answer, both seem to have been abusive. So yes the fight is really about how unfair society treats men who are domestically abused. 

there are videos like this https://youtu.be/PbXTr41ZFTQ
where they go into pretty in depth detail with some pretty interesting pieces of evidence on who was abusing who. 

also Amber Heard is just a shitty human. there are videos of her secretly recording interactions with Johnny where she purposely irritates him so he starts slamming cabinets and stuff. but he doesn't actually freak out on her.  https://youtu.be/V7lg69VFSY8",,3.0,,,,3.0,,,,,reddit

https://www.thecut.com/2016/06/amber-heards-ex-girlfriend-speaks-about-abuse.html,t3_k6wtmu,"*ETA, according to the cited articles, Amber was allegedly aware and consented to being recorded in the below referenced audio recordings between her and Depp. 

I consider myself a feminist but with everything I know about their accusations I don‚Äôt believe a word Amber Heard says...that‚Äôs my opinion anyways. There is an unknown number of legitimately abused women who suffer in silence and public accusations may give them the courage to come forward, but false accusations can also hurt real victims as well.  For me, the most telling piece of evidence is the recorded conversations between Johnny and Amber.  Now it seems that Johnny may have known that they were being recorded and Amber may not have so Johnny may be a little careful with what he says.  Regardless, Amber‚Äôs words and demeanor just don‚Äôt strike me as a woman who is being abused and fearful of her abuser.  In the recordings she admits to hitting him and says something to the effect of not being able to promise she won‚Äôt get physical again..that she gets so angry she loses it.  That statement right there indicates that she is aware of her behavior but tries to justify it under the guise of not being able to control herself. I work in a field where I regularly deal with victims of domestic violence. Women who are abused are usually fearful of their abusers and feel like they have to walk on eggshells to not enrage them, and every perceived slight from the abuser leads to them lashing out at their victim, whether the slight is only imagined or not. I‚Äôm not saying that all abused women don‚Äôt fight back, but the overwhelming majority of long time domestic violence victims don‚Äôt threaten their abuser with physical violence...particularly women who are smaller and weaker then a male partner.  Now those recordings in themselves are enough to make me believe that Amber is not a victim and at the very least, they‚Äôre mutual combatants in a violent and tumultuous relationship. However when you add other known factors in, it leads me to believe that not only is Amber not a victim, but she may actually be an abuser.  

Amber was previously arrested for allegedly assaulting her ex girlfriend in a public place, in plain view of police officers. She was observed allegedly striking the woman, grabbing her arm, and ripping a necklace off her neck. THOSE are the actions of an abuser. And if that was how she treated her in public, I can only imagine how she acts behind closed doors, particularly if alcohol or drugs are involved.  Now to be fair, her ex denied the allegations and the charges were dropped and later, at Amber‚Äôs (or her attorneys) request, deleted from the system...But Amber‚Äôs ex could be reacting as an abuse victim...protecting her abuser, denying allegations, and blaming others (in this case the police officers who saw the incident and stepped in).  I believe Amber and her ex may have even tried to claim that the officers were homophobic and misogynistic, but I think one of the officers came forward and stated that she was a lesbian and feminist and denied their allegations of prejudice.  Once again abusers will blame their victims and others for their actions and the victim will often protect them...I‚Äôve seen it so many times speaking to DV victims who swear their partner didn‚Äôt hurt them while they have visible bruises on their face and body. That is THE reason a lot of states enacted mandatory  domestic violence arrest laws where officers can make an arrest even if the victim is being uncooperative or denying abuse when the officer has reason to believe the abuse occurred (I.e black eyes, bruises, etc).  So now not only do you have her own words saying she can‚Äôt control herself, but you have an instance of past abuse allegations that was allegedly witnessed in a public place by police officers.  On the contrary, all of Johnny‚Äôs exes claim he was never abusive with them and even provided written statements saying as such. While I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily take their word for it, there‚Äôs witnesses who claim they saw Amber abusing a partner, and none (other than Amber‚Äôs sister who she allegedly also abused) that saw Johnny abusing Amber.  She‚Äôs also changed dates when confronted with evidence that proved she wasn‚Äôt injured in the form of photographs and witness testimony.  And when she changed those dates, her one and only witness, her sister, also changed the dates.  All of the people that were close to Amber and Johnny as a couple also claimed that Amber was the abuser. Not a single person who came forward (once again w the exception of Amber‚Äôs sister) said they saw Johnny ever be violent towards Amber, but most of them said that Amber was violent with him.  This includes Amber‚Äôs own former personal assistant.  As I stated, the only reason I even care about these celebrities or their civil suits and allegations is because I‚Äôm a strong advocate for women‚Äôs rights and holding domestic violence abusers accountable for their actions. But when women who aren‚Äôt victims claim they are, they risk real victims not being believed.  I think another allegation that speaks towards Amber‚Äôs character is claiming a rape that happened to one of her employees was her own experience. If that‚Äôs true that is absolutely abhorrent to me. 

These suits are being handled in civil courts. The burden of proof in civil courts is not nearly as high as the burden of proof in criminal courts. In criminal cases it‚Äôs beyond a reasonable doubt, in civil cases it‚Äôs a preponderance of the evidence.  That means if the jury or judge believes that there‚Äôs a 51% chance the allegations are true and a 49% chance they‚Äôre not, they will rule in their favor.  Civil court is a joke imo and I put zero stock into their rulings.  So regardless of what happens between the two of them in court, no matter who the rulings favor, that in no way is truly indicative of the truth.  I believe Johnny lost the initial suit against the Sun.  The Sun made like 14 allegations of abuse against Depp citing only Amber‚Äôs allegations.  The judge only had to believe that ONE of the 14 allegations could be true...that is an insane standard to beat, especially when you‚Äôre only going off of one parties word.  IMO Amber seems like a manipulative and unhinged person and I just don‚Äôt believe her.  I don‚Äôt believe Depp is 100% innocent for that matter, but I do believe that Amber was the primary emotional and physical aggressor and the abusive party.  You can hear it in the recordings from her own words.  She puts Depp down insinuating he‚Äôs old and fat and then refuses to take any responsibility for her physical aggression, instead insisting that Depp is responsible for her actions because he doesn‚Äôt stay around to endure her abuse.  I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm going to get a lot of heat on this thread for my comment but it‚Äôs what I truly believe based on my experience.  I‚Äôm including links to some articles, I know they aren‚Äôt all the most reliable sources, but celebrity gossip and civil allegations aren‚Äôt often covered by the MSM.

I consider myself a feminist but with everything I know about their accusations I don‚Äôt believe a word Amber Heard says...that‚Äôs my opinion anyways. There is an unknown number of legitimately abused women who suffer in silence and public accusations may give them the courage to come forward, but false accusations can also hurt real victims as well.  For me, the most telling piece of evidence is the recorded conversations between Johnny and Amber.  Now it seems that Johnny may have known that they were being recorded and Amber may not have so Johnny may be a little careful with what he says.  Regardless, Amber‚Äôs words and demeanor just don‚Äôt strike me as a woman who is being abused and fearful of her abuser.  In the recordings she admits to hitting him and says something to the effect of not being able to promise she won‚Äôt get physical again..that she gets so angry she loses it.  That statement right there indicates that she is aware of her behavior but tries to justify it under the guise of not being able to control herself. I work in a field where I regularly deal with victims of domestic violence. Women who are abused are usually fearful of their abusers and feel like they have to walk on eggshells to not enrage them, and every perceived slight from the abuser leads to them lashing out at their victim, whether the slight is only imagined or not. I‚Äôm not saying that all abused women don‚Äôt fight back, but the overwhelming majority of long time domestic violence victims don‚Äôt threaten their abuser with physical violence...particularly women who are smaller and weaker then a male partner.  Now those recordings in themselves are enough to make me believe that Amber is not a victim and at the very least, they‚Äôre mutual combatants in a violent and tumultuous relationship. However when you add other known factors in, it leads me to believe that not only is Amber not a victim, but she may actually be an abuser.  

Amber was previously arrested for allegedly assaulting her ex girlfriend in a public place, in plain view of police officers. She was observed allegedly striking the woman, grabbing her arm, and ripping a necklace off her neck. THOSE are the actions of an abuser. And if that was how she treated her in public, I can only imagine how she acts behind closed doors, particularly if alcohol or drugs are involved.

Reiterating the first answer, both seem to have been abusive. So yes the fight is really about how unfair society treats men who are domestically abused. 

there are videos like this https://youtu.be/PbXTr41ZFTQ
where they go into pretty in depth detail with some pretty interesting pieces of evidence on who was abusing who. 

also Amber Heard is just a shitty human. there are videos of her secretly recording interactions with Johnny where she purposely irritates him so he starts slamming cabinets and stuff. but he doesn't actually freak out on her.  https://youtu.be/V7lg69VFSY8",,3.0,,,,3.0,,,,,reddit

By the looks of it, Amber kept all of the money and any donation that was made, appears to be by her boyfriend at the time, Elon Musk, who has been a long-time donor to those 2 charities she said she would donate to. 
She would email (paper trail) them saying a donation was coming through anonymously. The amounts were about 250k and 500k and will most likely be revealed they are from him and not her, and will not be around the amount of 7 million dollars she promised to those charities. 

These amounts were also donated after the date she declared publicly, that she had already given all of the money over, she did this under oath so will face a perjury charge.

It takes a seriously horrid human to promise money to kids with cancer and deny them that support and care they desperately need.",,3.0,,,,3.0,,,,,reddit

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/5443023002,t3_k6wtmu,"*ETA, according to the cited articles, Amber was allegedly aware and consented to being recorded in the below referenced audio recordings between her and Depp. 

I consider myself a feminist but with everything I know about their accusations I don‚Äôt believe a word Amber Heard says...that‚Äôs my opinion anyways. There is an unknown number of legitimately abused women who suffer in silence and public accusations may give them the courage to come forward, but false accusations can also hurt real victims as well.  For me, the most telling piece of evidence is the recorded conversations between Johnny and Amber.  Now it seems that Johnny may have known that they were being recorded and Amber may not have so Johnny may be a little careful with what he says.  Regardless, Amber‚Äôs words and demeanor just don‚Äôt strike me as a woman who is being abused and fearful of her abuser.  In the recordings she admits to hitting him and says something to the effect of not being able to promise she won‚Äôt get physical again..that she gets so angry she loses it.  That statement right there indicates that she is aware of her behavior but tries to justify it under the guise of not being able to control herself. I work in a field where I regularly deal with victims of domestic violence. Women who are abused are usually fearful of their abusers and feel like they have to walk on eggshells to not enrage them, and every perceived slight from the abuser leads to them lashing out at their victim, whether the slight is only imagined or not. I‚Äôm not saying that all abused women don‚Äôt fight back, but the overwhelming majority of long time domestic violence victims don‚Äôt threaten their abuser with physical violence...particularly women who are smaller and weaker then a male partner.  Now those recordings in themselves are enough to make me believe that Amber is not a victim and at the very least, they‚Äôre mutual combatants in a violent and tumultuous relationship. However when you add other known factors in, it leads me to believe that not only is Amber not a victim, but she may actually be an abuser.  

Amber was previously arrested for allegedly assaulting her ex girlfriend in a public place, in plain view of police officers. She was observed allegedly striking the woman, grabbing her arm, and ripping a necklace off her neck. THOSE are the actions of an abuser. And if that was how she treated her in public, I can only imagine how she acts behind closed doors, particularly if alcohol or drugs are involved.  Now to be fair, her ex denied the allegations and the charges were dropped and later, at Amber‚Äôs (or her attorneys) request, deleted from the system...But Amber‚Äôs ex could be reacting as an abuse victim...protecting her abuser, denying allegations, and blaming others (in this case the police officers who saw the incident and stepped in).  I believe Amber and her ex may have even tried to claim that the officers were homophobic and misogynistic, but I think one of the officers came forward and stated that she was a lesbian and feminist and denied their allegations of prejudice.  Once again abusers will blame their victims and others for their actions and the victim will often protect them...I‚Äôve seen it so many times speaking to DV victims who swear their partner didn‚Äôt hurt them while they have visible bruises on their face and body. That is THE reason a lot of states enacted mandatory  domestic violence arrest laws where officers can make an arrest even if the victim is being uncooperative or denying abuse when the officer has reason to believe the abuse occurred (I.e black eyes, bruises, etc).  So now not only do you have her own words saying she can‚Äôt control herself, but you have an instance of past abuse allegations that was allegedly witnessed in a public place by police officers.  On the contrary, all of Johnny‚Äôs exes claim he was never abusive with them and even provided written statements saying as such. While I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily take their word for it, there‚Äôs witnesses who claim they saw Amber abusing a partner, and none (other than Amber‚Äôs sister who she allegedly also abused) that saw Johnny abusing Amber.  She‚Äôs also changed dates when confronted with evidence that proved she wasn‚Äôt injured in the form of photographs and witness testimony.  And when she changed those dates, her one and only witness, her sister, also changed the dates.  All of the people that were close to Amber and Johnny as a couple also claimed that Amber was the abuser. Not a single person who came forward (once again w the exception of Amber‚Äôs sister) said they saw Johnny ever be violent towards Amber, but most of them said that Amber was violent with him.  This includes Amber‚Äôs own former personal assistant.  As I stated, the only reason I even care about these celebrities or their civil suits and allegations is because I‚Äôm a strong advocate for women‚Äôs rights and holding domestic violence abusers accountable for their actions. But when women who aren‚Äôt victims claim they are, they risk real victims not being believed.  I think another allegation that speaks towards Amber‚Äôs character is claiming a rape that happened to one of her employees was her own experience. If that‚Äôs true that is absolutely abhorrent to me. 

These suits are being handled in civil courts. The burden of proof in civil courts is not nearly as high as the burden of proof in criminal courts. In criminal cases it‚Äôs beyond a reasonable doubt, in civil cases it‚Äôs a preponderance of the evidence.  That means if the jury or judge believes that there‚Äôs a 51% chance the allegations are true and a 49% chance they‚Äôre not, they will rule in their favor.  Civil court is a joke imo and I put zero stock into their rulings.  So regardless of what happens between the two of them in court, no matter who the rulings favor, that in no way is truly indicative of the truth.  I believe Johnny lost the initial suit against the Sun.  The Sun made like 14 allegations of abuse against Depp citing only Amber‚Äôs allegations.  The judge only had to believe that ONE of the 14 allegations could be true...that is an insane standard to beat, especially when you‚Äôre only going off of one parties word.  IMO Amber seems like a manipulative and unhinged person and I just don‚Äôt believe her.  I don‚Äôt believe Depp is 100% innocent for that matter, but I do believe that Amber was the primary emotional and physical aggressor and the abusive party.  You can hear it in the recordings from her own words.  She puts Depp down insinuating he‚Äôs old and fat and then refuses to take any responsibility for her physical aggression, instead insisting that Depp is responsible for her actions because he doesn‚Äôt stay around to endure her abuse.  I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm going to get a lot of heat on this thread for my comment but it‚Äôs what I truly believe based on my experience.  I‚Äôm including links to some articles, I know they aren‚Äôt all the most reliable sources, but celebrity gossip and civil allegations aren‚Äôt often covered by the MSM.

https://screenrant.com/wb-amber-heard-johnny-depp-aquaman-2-fire-different/,t1_godpmun,"No, Amber would be one of the ones who would know whether or not she was fired and she is contractually obligated to be honest about it because if she was actually fired and she said she wasn‚Äôt, that would be bad. She just added a bunch of baggage about how ‚Äústupid‚Äù it was because she‚Äôs a shit human being. However she‚Äôs contractually obligated to be truthful about it, or at least in line with what the studio wants to say publicly. If she ends up getting axed later, awesome, but for now WB has basically stated that AH is still on for all intents and purposes. 

[Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/wb-amber-heard-johnny-depp-aquaman-2-fire-different/) actually did a good analysis on this, one of the few actually good summaries I‚Äôve seen from them. Essentially it boils down to the fact that the court of public opinion is not as powerful as the actual legal court system. The actual legal court system has precedent on the side of Heard, however unfair that may be, the result of this is that studios will not have a huge incentive to axe her from the film. The boycott has reached about two million supporters (of which I am one) but let‚Äôs be real, two million boycotters is a tiny number compared to the hundreds of millions who are still probably going to watch the movie. 

The only way this could actually change is if Amber loses the Virginia case, which should ideally happen if the judge isn‚Äôt a personal friend of hers like justice Nichol. If she loses that case, then she‚Äôs much more likely to be axed, and I personally suspect the studio is quietly bringing her screen time down for this reason, because the court case would happen mid-filming, and if she was cut mid-filming, the impact to the movie can only be reduced by having reduced screen time for her character.",,3.0,,,,3.0,,,,,reddit
