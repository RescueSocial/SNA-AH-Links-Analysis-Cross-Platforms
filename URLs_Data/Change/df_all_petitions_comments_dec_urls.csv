810989875,"Amber Heard inspires us!  We support her life, her role in Aquaman 2, her humanitarian work, and any work she has. We support her evidence and public safety to save lives.

Amber is not only powerful as Mera, but she is also an activist for human rights.

She was the first American actress to be named Human Rights Champion to the United Nations Human Rights Office.

She's an ambassador for the ACLU, donor to Women's Rights Groups, protector of refugees, and does charity. She has spent years helping children.

She's an inner philanthropist and advocate who should have a voice.

We want to see her in more films, movies, shows, modeling, and work in the entertainment industry. We want to see more equal rights advocacy!

She's a positive influence on us and we should see more of her!

We want powerful women who can be respected and treated equally.

We created this petition because we support women who have been domestically abused and we would prevent violence against women. We want her humanitarian work and leadership to continue... Would you stand up to prevent or stop domestic abuse? The social question is also: ""Would you save her?""

We support Amber Heard's life and her humanitarian work...

Amber Heard was domestically abused by her ex-husband and is still abused by Johnny Depp and his followers with coercive control, threats, incited hate, financially, emotionally, and online daily. We would rather not refer to him, but we need to support women who go against powerful people and believe the victims.

Amber Heard wrote in the Washington Post, as an Ambassador for the ACLU, about how she had to change her phone number weekly due to death threats from Depp fans and how she supports rights: ""Amber Heard: I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change."" 

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman. We should be able to speak out to create change.

We can change culture to improve lives...

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims.

Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

She has extensive evidence supporting her:

UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).

According to an anonymous source saying she was the partner of ex-JD staff on social media March 29 to April 2019: Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots: google folder and video.

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.

Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

According to an anonymous source saying she was the partner of ex-JD staff on social media March 29 to April 2019: Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots: google folder and video.

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.
Staff knew and saw that she was injured by Depp... When the source contacted us knowing she was abused, and showed us a missing person's photo of someone who was going to testify against JD, it made it our responsibility to try to help Amber Heard...

Our petition was encouraged by The Geek Buzz, a supporter of the 1938 comic issue of Superman stopping domestic violence. 

We hope for Amber's success in life long-term and thank her for her causes! It's changed lives for the better.
It's an assault against all women to silence Amber or other victims for speaking out against violence either in spoken words or Op-Eds.

The enabling culture of abuse that she spoke against in her Washington Post December 2018 Op-ed article is exactly what's being created after she wrote it by not allowing her to have support publicly or online by preventing progress.

We care and we want leaders like Amber Heard who advocate for equality!
It doesn't matter to these others how much philanthropy or good work she does - she's never perfect enough to them.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

She has extensive evidence supporting her:

UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.

Staff were on NDAs, witnessed the couple fighting yet would stop interfering, and would check on Amber after their fights. They supported Amber and said she was kicked repeatedly, hit, and crying, but they were too afraid to witness. Screenshots..

In the July 2020 UK NGN court trial's exposures showing strong support for Amber Heard, the statements that she was abused are supported by seen physical injuries and distress of Amber, damaged property, witnessed abuse, and staff being bystanders by not helping her in the witness statements by Josh Drew, Melanie Inglessis, Whitney Henriquez, Kristina Sexton, IO Tillet-Wright, Raquel Pennington, and by other statements, data, and recordings as referenced in NGN's closing submissions.

There are more witnesses supporting her for the 2nd Virginia, United States case about her Washington Post Op-Ed.

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.
- Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

Amber Heard won and is innocent... UK Judge Nicol ruled that 12 domestic violence incidents against Amber Heard were valid on November 2, 2020 with a winning case for her and NGN News.

We support the facts, legal rulings, and science supporting Amber!

Amber Heard is innocent and we support her leadership, such as her advocacy with the United Nations and American Civil Liberties Union, being a spokesperson for L'Oreal, her contracts with businesses, nonprofits, and causes, and her largest movie role as Mera in Aquaman.

We should be able to speak out to create change. We defend against the hate groups harming her online. We support her humanitarian work and human lives. We support new technology for safety and equality.

We support Warner Bros who removed her ex from his role and is supporting Amber's life by keeping her in Aquaman 2.

We can change culture to improve lives... See evidence below.

The abuse against Amber includes choking her repeatedly, a concussion, over a dozen physical experiences of violence, pushing, control of travel, isolation, losing weight and physical health while with Depp, losing confidence, and intimidation. 

In deposition videos in 2016, she said that she screamed for help and that no one interfered.

Society is not only not victim-centered to tell women to protect themselves; it isn’t proactive to tell us to help victims. Gathering data and leading for change is exactly what Amber Heard should have done!

Amber Heard showed accurate and detailed evidence of photos, texts, audios, videos, data, medical references, and descriptions of abuse, threats, injuries, distress, and violence from Depp in her legal filings, in her dismissals, in the cases of retaliation against her for saying she was abused, and in court.

Amber Heard has extensive evidence supporting her:

- UK Judge Nicol ruled on November 2, 2020 that the abuse against Amber is valid.
He validated 12 physical assaults against Amber with a Winning case for her & NGN in the United Kingdom and that ""Depp put her in fear of her life."" (129 pages).
- Her first April 2019 dismissal has photos, texts, and descriptions: <a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5835867-Amber-Heard-Motion-to-Dismiss.html</a>

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

809963632,"Amber is still in Aquaman 2, spokesperson for L'Oreal, and involved with nonprofits, and we support this.

We support businesses that help women who are domestically abused. 

Here are more evidence and facts of this abusive, deadly, and enabled situation that is to create violence against women and leaders like Amber Heard who try to bring awareness - even to the United Nations General Assembly.

What you should know - background:

Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. ""And we never will be...unless we're dead."" 
Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.
Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.
Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.
Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.
Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.

911 cannot even locate with data to know where a caller is or use text information.

See TrueHollywoodTalk's Article showing the issues of public safety technology and culture:  ""Amber Heard’s Story of Cyber Abuse Inspires Change to Public Safety to Save Lives"": <a href=""https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.truehollywoodtalk.com/amber-heards-story-cyberabuse-inspires-change-public-safety-save-lives/</a>

Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.

Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.

Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.

Then retaliation, such as seen against Amber Heard, makes people too afraid to try to create change or to even speak about change.

When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.

By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.

When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.

Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.

It’s rationalizing harming women with escalations to a crime scene.

“I accept that Mr. Depp put her in fear of her life,” a British judge wrote, dismissing the actor’s libel case on Monday...

Johnny Depp on Monday lost his court case against a British newspaper that called him a “wife beater” and claimed there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had assaulted the actress Amber Heard repeatedly during their marriage.

Mr. Depp’s assaults included head-butting Ms. Heard, repeatedly hitting her and tearing out clumps of her hair, wrote Andrew Nicol, the British judge who heard the case, in a ruling issued online on Monday. In dismissing the case, he said the defendants had shown that what they published was “substantially true.”

The assaults “must have been terrifying,” the judge wrote regarding incidents in March 2015 in Australia, in which Ms. Heard said that Mr. Depp assaulted her several times, including smashing a telephone beside her face. “I accept that Mr. Depp put her in fear of her life,” the judge wrote.

The judge also acknowledged the risk Ms. Heard had taken in speaking up about the violence. “I also accept that Ms. Heard’s allegations have had a negative effect on her career as an actor and activist,” he said.

Women’s rights groups in Britain praised the decision. “This is an important ruling and one which we hope sends a very powerful message: Every single survivor of domestic abuse should be listened to and should be heard,” Lisa King, a spokeswoman for Refuge, a British charity for survivors of domestic violence, said in a statement...

The article [from NGN] called Mr. Depp a “wife beater” and urged the author J.K. Rowling to intervene and have Mr. Depp removed from the “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” movie series, based on her book.

The newspaper’s legal team argued that the accusations in the article were “accurate and true.” Ms. Heard, 34, testified on the newspaper’s behalf and said in pretrial documents that Mr. Depp had assaulted her on 14 occasions during their relationship starting before they were married. Mr. Depp denied all of the claims, but the judge found that most of them did occur, citing a range of text messages from Mr. Depp among the evidence....

After the ruling was issued on Monday, The Sun said in a statement, “Domestic abuse victims must never be silenced, and we thank the judge for his careful consideration and thank Amber Heard for her courage in giving evidence to the court.”

Jennifer Robinson, a lawyer for Ms. Heard, said the actress was “unable to comment on the case due to the ongoing U.S. proceedings.” But Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, Ms. Heard’s American lawyer, said in a statement that the judgment was “not a surprise.”

“We are committed to obtaining justice for Amber Heard in the U.S. Court and defending Ms. Heard’s right to free speech,” Ms. Bredehoft said.""

From The Guardian: 

How Amber Heard stood alone against a Hollywood superstar

Unlike him, however, she was given a police escort because of threats from Depp’s fans...

In 12 out of the 14 incidents of assault reported by Heard in open court, the judge said he found the allegations proved on the balance of probabilities...

More seriously – say sources close to Heard – both she and her sister Whitney have received anonymous death threats. Harassing messages were also sent to the chambers of Jennifer Robinson, the human rights lawyer whose clients include Julian Assange and who attended court with Heard, alongside Heard’s partner, Bianca Butti, and a US attorney, Elaine Bredehoft.

Other voices, while not aligned specifically with Heard, had spoken up outside of court, such as the Labour frontbench MP Jess Phillips, who voiced concern about what she had read in coverage “that seems to be a character assassination of Heard, leaning too far, in my opinion, towards the old tropes about domestic abuse that campaigners like me have tried for years to combat...”",0,0,Event,20197634,5,comment,2020-12-01 23:49:40+00:00,,1136503772,1136503772,Green Arrow,Science,Green Arrow,Green Arrow Science,La Jolla Shores,CA,US,https://www.twitter.com/realamberheard,en-US,"Motivation as the main idea.
