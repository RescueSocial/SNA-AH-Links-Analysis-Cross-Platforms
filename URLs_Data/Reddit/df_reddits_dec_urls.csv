Hello /u/AgentJ777.  you do not have enough karma to post. You need more than 2500 **total karma** to post here.

No, award karma doesn't count. We don't do P2W here.

Check your karma breakdown here:  http://old.reddit.com/u/AgentJ777/overview

Read this for an explanation of post vs comment karma:

In the meantime, feel free to post your OC memes in **r/specialsnowflake** to gain entry before you reach 2500

**Please direct questions about that to the r/specialsnowflake team**

Hello /u/Cxm-.  you do not have enough karma to post. You need more than 2500 **total karma** to post here.

No, award karma doesn't count. We don't do P2W here.

Unfortunately, she's being proven absoloutly right everyday on her recorded threat to Johnny that nobody will believe him because he's a man.

Johnny's reputation is in shambles and Hollywood has turned on him.  Meanwhile, Amber Heard is lauded by the UN as a spokesperson in the fight against domestic violence and is given lucrative oppertunites for speaking engagements on said topic.

I wish I wasn't kidding on the last part.

That is a rundown of everything that has happened, it is unbiased so you can draw your own conclusion.

Take note how he has had previous partners, police officers and medical practitioners come forward with evidence of abuse from Amber Heard. 

Depp also released counseling recording that has Amber Heard admitting to wrong doing and says to quote:

>	""I can't promise you I won't get physical again. God, I f---ing sometimes get so mad I lose it.""

There are other news articles and reports out there, I’ll also link to the raw audio that Depp released below.

I will personally explain what she tried to extort and paste the links, because you're a lazy S.O.B . 

She tried to get a Land Rover, three of his penthouses, 125k for legal fees and $50k a month payments until death. This can be found here: https://twitter.com/ifod_net/status/1025299758536110080?s=19

The donations she promised to charity which I will quote from Amber Heard: 
""As reported in the media, the amount received in the divorce was $7 million and $7 million is being donated. This is over and above any funds that I have given away in the past and will continue to give away in the future."" Link found here: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/johnny-depp-amber-heard-divorce-read-statement-full-settlement-charity-donation-a7198621.html

The Judge has now asked for receipts which Amber has tried to quash in court several times. Anyone who has donated, would be happy to hand those over, but not Amber, because she did not donate it. Request for receipts found here :https://twitter.com/LauraBockov/status/1340403775215988736?s=09

Information from the charity's website with a list of lifetime donors, which states she has not donated the money: https://twitter.com/RubiksGlass/status/1327389636184973314?s=19

Psychological abuse, often called emotional abuse, is a form of abuse, characterized by a person subjecting or exposing another person to behavior that may result in psychological trauma, including anxiety, chronic depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder. It is often associated with situations of power imbalance in abusive relationships, and may include bullying, gaslighting, and abuse in the workplace. It also may be perpetrated by persons conducting torture, other violence, acute or prolonged human rights abuse, particularly without legal redress such as detention without trial, false accusations, false convictions and extreme defamation such as where perpetrated by state and media.

   Steve here. I am a computing student, and recently I created my own YouTube game show series. In the show we pit two of our favorite celebrities against each other and a computer called Samantha decides the winner, and gives you the answer to the question once and for all, which celebrity is the hottest?!    
   I hope you will check out my latest episode, which features Margot Robbie Vs Jennifer Lawrence!    
   Please check it out, subscribe to the channel and leave a comment below to let me know who you would like to see facing off in future episodes!

The question is not 'women provoking men into bearing them' 'that is you deliberately phrasing a false position that paints women as victims and men as aggressors who ran out of patience. 

It's fairly well established that [a vast % ( apparently 50%) of domestic violence is reciprocal ](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1d6uw9/til_that_50_of_domestic_violence_is_reciprocal_53/)

[men are less likely to report domestic violence ](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-psychiatrist/article/domestic-violence-is-most-commonly-reciprocal/C5432B0C6F8F61B49A4E2B60B931FA07&ved=2ahUKEwjIk_aEm9TtAhXUQxUIHZtkCJMQFjABegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw1PlTY8nyPkf58m_APOS8ek&cshid=1608180510280)

So to frame any domestic violence situation as simply women provoking men into beating them is a terribly inaccurate take on the situation. 

When it comes to reciprocal violence unless you reach self defence levels then 'what if Depp provoked Heards  agggression' is not really a valid question. Would me saying what did Heard do to provoke Depps aggression be a fair question to ask?! What level of provocation is acceptable? If he insults her does he deserve to get a slap? 

As to your last point I don't know enough about the details to say if the level of response was appropriate. But I have heard she chopped off a chunk of his finger so I would say at that stage pretty much any non lethal violence is a fair and appropriate level of self defence.",t1_gg3ez3t,r/MensRights,Bojack35,2020-12-17 05:00:52+00:00,"[{'display_url': 'https://www.reddit.com'}, {'display_url': 'https://www.google.com'}, {'display_url': 'https://www.cambridge.org'}]",Positive,Neutral,"['https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1d6uw9/til_that_50_of_domestic_violence_is_reciprocal_53/', 'https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-psychiatrist/article/domestic-violence-is-most-commonly-reciprocal/C5432B0C6F8F61B49A4E2B60B931FA07&ved=2ahUKEwjIk_aEm9TtAhXUQxUIHZtkCJMQFjABegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw1PlTY8nyPkf58m_APOS8ek&cshid=1608180510280']",2

Your submission has been removed for the following reason(s):

* Rule #2 - Questions must seek objective explanations

* Recent/current events are not allowed on ELI5. First, these are usually asking for factual answers or opinions. Additionally, information about these events is usually still developing, making objective and accurate answers difficult (Rule 2).

Link to that video of Amber abusing her ex.
I could go deeper and give you more concrete evidence but unfortunately I don't have the time right now.
https://youtu.be/Lc4hf4w7QXA
Here is the link for the audio recordings of Heard.
She was abusing Depp and saying no one will believe him because he is a man.
There's tons more vids I can find for you, but as I said before I don't have the time.
Make any argument you want but the majority of the internet is against Heard. It's obvious she's the abuser. There is no use arguing against an idiot since they think they're always right.

The sun (and the person that wrote it) didn't even appear as a witness in the case. It was her in court as a witness saying he'd abused her. That's the case to defend the sun. Her testimony.
Regardless of what she did to him, the judge believed her that he'd hit her.

Basically the whole thing seems to be that they had a fucked up relationship (and that's giving her the benefit of the doubt). It *seems* she was indeed the abuser (actual evidence for this include recordings of her hitting him and saying nobody would believe him, him needing surgery after having glass thrown at him, her shitting in his bed and other incidents) but he physically retaliated at times (haven't seen any actual proof of this even quoted but apparently happened on a few occasions).

Now back to the point. This post is here because she's now trying to represent VICTIMS of abuse. That is seriously fucked up and people have a right to be angry. That's what the post is about.
Looks like she was right when she told him that nobody would believe him.

In other words, in the judge's opinion, based on the facts presented, in those incidents it was more likely that Depp did abuse Amber than not.

If you read the Judges ruling ([available here](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Judgment-FINAL.pdf)) it says that his assessment for some of the instances hinges on the other instances being true.

For example, read the first instance , paragraph 210:

>Seen in isolation, the evidence that Mr Depp assaulted Ms Heard on this occasion might not be sufficient. However, taken with the evidence as a whole, I find that it did occur.

The judge made some obvious mistakes. Depp was telling the truth about the writing in red not being his. Depp always uses a lowercase i and lowercase t yet the judge did not believe Depp on this and considered his testimony unreliable.

The judge concluded the red ""CALL CARLY SIMON, SHE SAID IT BETTER BABE"" on the bottom left was written by Johnny Depp. Here is a pic:

The judge accepted that on the way to the hospital, Depp and his friend discussed making up reasons for the severed finger. However the judge supposes that Depp accidentally cut his finger on glass.

The Court has statements of case in which Heard made 14 open allegations of assault against Depp; there was also a ""confidential annex"" (and a confidential response) and in the absence of any statement by the court as to why they are confidential we can only speculate. Depp pleaded to each allegation made by Heard setting out how his version of events differs from hers. The Court then heard from about 20 or so witnesses (including Heard and Depp) and then - pay attention here -

*the court had to make a finding of fact in relation of each of those allegations.*

If the Court had found that Heard had failed to convince it in every one of those allegations, it would have had to find that the claim was made out and the Sun would have had to pay damages.

As it was, the Court found that she had failed to 'come up to proof' on only 2 of the open allegations and one of the confidential ones. In other words, the Court found *as a fact* that Depp had assaulted Heard on no fewer than 12 occasions.

**1. That is not what I am doing**, she is both an abuser and a victim.

**2. Even if I was saying that it would not be sexist you imbecile.**

You do know there is evidence of Amber Heard domestically abusing Johnny Depp right? Johnny isn't perfect himself, I am not saying that nor does he.
I am simply pointing out that she is an abuser as well as a victim. Someone who commits domestic violence should not then be giving talks on domestic abuse. Surely you a smart to enough to understand that? Or is that rational conclusion a bit too much for you?

Here is an audio recording of a conversation between Johnny and Amber: https://youtu.be/0oe2Tfix9-k

Here is a video recording of Amber smiling, laughing, rolling her eyes etc as she listens to audio recordings (note how bored she looks, eating away like it just another day. Doesn't look like too much of how a real domestic abuse victim would act listening to recordings. It would be a traumatic experience): https://youtu.be/qD5OeOKkhXM

In this video, Johnny is angry and aggressively opening cabinets etc which I do not condone. However, this shows how much of a sneaky, lying snake she is. Sets up a camera, covering it so he doesn't see it and it trying to get him to do something to her so she can go ""see what he did!"":

There were 14 open incidents in which Heard claims Depp assaulted her, together with one or more ""confidential"" incidents. The judgment doesn't say why they were held ""confidential"", but one possibility is that they were allegations of sexual impropriety. (Could be something else.)

The Court found that of those 14 incidents, 12 of them were made out to the civil standard, with 2 not made out and at least one of the allegations in the ""confidential annex"" not made out either.

If you read the judgment, you will see why the Court accepted which evidence it was given: for example, photographs supposedly taken on specific dates were later acknowledged to have been taken on different dates; the police officers who claimed not to have seen any sign of injury on Amber Heard took no contemporary notes and were not asked to give depositions for at least two months, at which time they said they had been in Depp's apartment for 60 minutes when the CCTV camera footage showed that they were there less than 15 minutes and they had to admit they had not been nearer to Amber Heard than 20 feet.

As I've said elsewhere, this trial only considered whether Depp was a 'wife beater'; it did not consider whether Heard was a husband beater.

She was abusing Depp and saying no one will believe him because he is a man.

Make any argument you want but the majority of the internet is against Heard. It's obvious she's the abuser. There is no use arguing against an idiot since they think they're always right. Maybe the only reason you're supporting her is because you're an abuser too. Whichever is the case we can go around in circles all day.

Jenny Afia of Schillings law firm, who represented Mr Depp, said: ""This decision is as perverse as it is bewildering.

""Most troubling is the judge's reliance on the testimony of Amber Heard, and corresponding disregard of the mountain of counter-evidence from police officers, medical practitioners, her own former assistant, other unchallenged witnesses and an array of documentary evidence which completely undermined the allegations, point by point.""

""The judgement is so flawed that it would be ridiculous for Mr Depp not to appeal this decision,"" she added.

Well, yes. You have to distinguish between findings of fact and the judgment on the claim. It was necessary for the court to find whether Depp was a ""wife beater"" in order for it to make judgment on the claim, viz. that there had been no libel. 

A newspaper doesn't have 'beliefs', it has no mind. 

This is what the judge said about what was referred to as 'Incident 1':

>210: Seen in isolation, the evidence that Mr Depp assaulted Ms Heard on this occasion might not be sufficient. However, taken with the evidence as a whole, I find that it did occur.  

This is a finding that ""Mr Depp assaulted Ms Heard"". There are other findings with respect to other Incidents.

That's not the part that's ambiguous. What's ambiguous is whether she's the instigator/abuser/what-have-you in the relationship, or whether those were instances of self-defense/retaliation against the person who was regularly the instigator/abuser/what-have-you, or whether they're both shitty abusive people beating up on each other.

The ""nobody will believe you"" recording - that could be an abusive person trying to intimidate her victim into silence, or it could be the victim standing up to her abuser by telling him people aren't going to believe his [DARVO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARVO) attempt, or it could, again, just be two shitty people both trying to weaponize the courts and public opinion in their ongoing personal grudge-fest.

Men have no access to domestic abuse shelters, despite research indicating that domestic abuse against men is almost at parity with women. ^[11](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/110127/dq110127a-eng.htm)  In addition to that, the entire court system in the United States strongly favors women. Some studies [indicate a 60-65% disparity](https://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx) between male and female sentences for the exact same crimes. U.S prisons are comprised of 95% men.

Also, rape against males is rarely penalized when a woman is the actor. in fact, there is impunity for the act. If you wanted to, you could rape your male associate. No one would care. And, you could probably get a sweet new car with the settlement. 

Far be it of me to question your benevolent movement, though.",t1_gg2am4q,r/MensRights,Openworldgamer47,2020-12-16 20:33:34+00:00,"[{'display_url': 'https://www.theduluthmodel.org'}, {'display_url': 'https://www150.statcan.gc.ca'}, {'display_url': 'https://www.law.umich.edu'}]",Positive,Neutral,"['https://www.theduluthmodel.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PowerandControl.pdf', 'https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/110127/dq110127a-eng.htm', 'https://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx']",3

It's the premise that the sexes should be treated equally. I think this is a reoccurring problem I often see in this debate linguistically. People conflate feminism with women's rights. *Women's rights* is also a static concept. The idea of advocating for women. That's something that I would subscribe to. I would however not subscribe to the ideology of feminism. Which is ever-changing, and beholden to the views of that movement's constituents. 

> I never implied you were the problem.

I think that's an oversight on your part. One of the reoccurring notions I've seen from people that advocate for men's rights is that they often feel blamed for all the ills of society. Again, I'll defer to linguistics. *Fem-* as a root word is gynocentric. *Patriarchy* describes males, *toxic masculinity* refers to immutable characteristics possessed by males, *rape culture* implies that raping is a pervasive trend among males. In every circumstance, my existence is deemed the fundamental problem. 

You can't relate to that. You don't know what it's like to advocate for your issues, and then enter every single conversation with the underlying impression that the other person perceives your existence to be problematic. Or your concerns to be trivial. 

I think that [Cassie Jaye](https://youtu.be/T-aiiDrEuhE) illustrated this point better than I ever could. I edited out a clip from *The Red Pill* to demonstrate my point better.

What if I suggested that women are inherently prone to deception? Sure, seems like *some* women are. There is always that insinuation though, that *you* are as well. Naturally you would become defensive. Men *are* more prone to violence. I said that plainly. But I think it's the *WRONG APPROACH* to tell every single young boy (like I was told) not to be a rapist. That makes them afraid of women. That makes them socially isolate themselves. That makes them sexually dysfunctional. That makes weak, and vulnerable, and unable to communicate with women normally. In essence, it facilitates the problem. 

> If you have evidence to back up that women cause a lot of issues, systemically, economically, and are historically oppressive, then go right on ahead.

Why would I do that? And perpetuate this useless cycle of bickering? I would facilitate a dialogue. I would drop any labels or tribalism. And I would purely address the issue itself.

It's ok if we're hopelessly disparate politically. I'm not gonna change your mind. You're not gonna change mine. I just wish men had a voice in the first place. Cause right now, we don't. If I try to organize protestors will be there. If I try to upload videos they will be taken down. If I try to do literally anything publicly to advocate for my issues people with attack me. That's another thing you just can't relate to.

The only reason a huge, multimillionaire star and lead actor in a major movie franchise would get dropped in Hollywood is if they couldn't insure him any more. And a lot of the reasons why a person would be deemed too costly to insure would be drug/alcohol addiction, particularly of the variety that makes a person unable to work in a reliable fashion, especially in an industry like Hollywood, where time is fucking everything. Johnny Depp has been late, holding up shooting, and a lot of the time, refuses to show up for commitments he promises he'd show up for. If you don't fucking show up for work, you'll get fired.

But even that could be excusable, provided he had a team who could get him to where he needs to be on time, or if there are people in the industry who are powerful enough and capable enough to vouch for him, in spite of all that. Except Johnny Depp has been spending the better part of the last few years burning bridges with anyone who could bother to defend him. [This article says it all:](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/hes-radioactive-inside-johnny-depps-self-made-implosion)

>""One studio executive who has worked with Depp in recent years says  his inner demons had long ago bled into his professional life, making  him ""a huge liability"" thanks to frequent tardiness and costly behavior,  all cataloged in the U.K. suit.  
>  
>""The discovery that came out in that trial alone would be enough to scare any studio,"" says the executive."" 

And he has a shitty team of professionals to run his life:

>To many observers, Depp's negative press was largely avoidable and  stemmed from his aggressive legal tactics. The chief architect behind  Depp's sue-'em-all strategy is Adam Waldman, a handsome Washington  lawyer with his own sheen of controversy given a clientele that has  included Russian oligarchs and Julian Assange. Waldman, who is married  to Berlin-based jet-setter and luxury skin-care entrepreneur Barbara  Sturm, conducts himself in an unorthodox manner, mocking his legal  opponents on Twitter. Sources say Depp met Waldman through Saudi Arabian  Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the country's powerful minister of energy,  in summer 2016. (Depp spent time aboard the prince's megayacht in the  past.)

And this was after he fired his agent of three decades, sued his long term business manager, and also sued his entertainment lawyer and supposed ""father figure."" 

Not only that, but because he's proceeding with the legal actions against Heard in America now, there's a chance he'll be asked to air not just his dirty laundry, but that of other people as well. So he's been burning down bridges and pissing on the ashes as well, and he has surrounded himself by some of the worst people to be with right now.

The Defamation Act 2013 (c 26) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which reformed English defamation law on issues of the right to freedom of expression and the protection of reputation. It also comprised a response to perceptions that the law as it stood was giving rise to libel tourism and other inappropriate claims. The Act changed existing criteria for a successful claim, by requiring claimants to show actual or probable serious harm (which, in the case of for-profit bodies, is restricted to serious financial loss), before suing for defamation in England or Wales, setting limits on geographical relevance, removing the previous presumption in favour of a trial by jury, and curtailing sharply the scope for claims of continuing defamation (in which republication or continued visibility constitutes ongoing renewed defamation). It also enhanced existing defences, by introducing a defence for website operators hosting user-generated content (provided they comply with a procedure to enable the complainant to resolve disputes directly with the author of the material concerned or otherwise remove it), and introducing new statutory defences of truth, honest opinion, and ""publication on a matter of public interest"" or privileged publications (including peer reviewed scientific journals), to replace the common law defences of justification, fair comment, and the Reynolds defence respectively.

Under english libel law, the ONLY thing that can prevent the Sun from having to pay damages is if they can prove what they wrote is correct. 

That's very passionate opinion but its also not how British libel laws work. There are five defenses against defamation in the UK, truth is only one.

I did manage to find the actual judgement: [https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Judgment-FINAL.pdf](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Judgment-FINAL.pdf)

The Sun chose to rely solely on the defense of truth in this case. However the judge notes that the defendant must only show that what they said is more likely true than false. They don't have to ""prove"" it to a very strict standard.

Also the case doesn't seem to consider the meaning of the term ""wife beater"" at all (though its long and I only skimmed to see what the defense used was). If Depp was abused and defending himself he may have hit Heard but that would hardly make him a wife beater. I think that's the real salient issue here.

Like if someone had a boxing match against a gay person would The Sun really be allowed to call them a ""gay basher""?

Apparently Amber also accused Depp of the assault during the texts in question and shared multiple photos of herself with visible injuries after requesting a restraining order. However when the police were called to the scene over a domestic call they found no evidence of any physical injuries after examining her. I do not know though if these were the same text messages used in the court case with the Sun tabloid defending their use of the term wife beater or a different set of texts sent between them. 

However she’s fabricated so much evidence and made so many claims, I can see why people are skeptical of her claims, and also why they’ll be appealing the verdict. Her also being arrested for physically abusing a previous partner prior to this whole shitshow with Johnny Depp is also concerning.

This thing? You know, when Depp tried to argue he wasn't a ""wife beater"" but the court said ""...but you did abuse her. Multiple times."" You can scroll all the way down for the final ruling.

The ""people calling for losing of jobs"" never happened. Heard and Depp's abuse issues happened years ago. They were basically a dead topic. The Sun published Heard's claims that Depp abused her, so Depp sued The Sun for libel as an attempt to get Heard in court, herself.

A judge not only found that 12 out of 14 of Heard's claims were substantiated as truthful, but also admonished  Depp for trying to use a libel case against a third party to make his ex-wife a witness in that same libel case.

It was losing the libel case that resulted in WB firing Depp because he basically kicked an otherwise dormant hornet's nest *and* a court now validated Heard's abuse claims as ""truthful enough to publish"" - paraphrasing mine.

The motte-and-bailey fallacy (named after the motte-and-bailey castle) is a form of argument and an informal fallacy where an arguer conflates two positions which share similarities, one modest and easy to defend (the ""motte"") and one much more controversial (the ""bailey""). The arguer advances the controversial position, but when challenged, they insist that they are only advancing the more modest position. Upon retreating to the motte, the arguer can claim that the bailey has not been refuted (because the critic refused to attack the motte) or that the critic is unreasonable (by equating an attack on the bailey with an attack on the motte).

Did you know, the police in our country originate from slave patrols? Again, read about the prison industrial complex and its history, as well as how the 13th amendment is worded in a way that allowed it to happen.

Also, no matter how much additional training they get, how many seminars or counseling sessions are given on police brutality, how much additional money they get, the police are going to brutalize people. That’s their job. They go in to force someone to live in a place designed to punish, and if they resist, they must forcibly arrest them. You can’t honestly expect that even with those measures, not a single cop is going to continue to be an abuser of power. 

Also you misunderstand the culture. Not every cop is genuinely a bad person, but police academy teaches you that every civilian you meet could be someone you have to be prepared to arrest, tackle, or shoot. Police are loyal to each other to a fault. Calling another cop out for wrong doing or be any sort of whistleblower is highly looked down upon, and that sentiment exists in every level of the hierarchy. Cops who do are usually fired and can end up getting killed. Good cops don’t exist because truly good cops, the ones who stay quiet, don’t last. No matter how much training you give them, how much you raise their salaries by, poorer communities (the areas that are most commonly over policed) have nothing but misery to gain from the continued existence of police. They need to be abolished.

Anyways, look at the city budgets for police departments compared to any other social program. The budget is often billions higher than even the fire departments. Imagine how many people’s lives would improve if we used the money the police use for better equipment and better riot gear to instead fund social programs, like education for instance. If instead of consolidating power to a single group, we have individuals in communities work together to look out for the entire community- this could also be funded with the abundant amounts of money the police are given.
Detectives should still be a thing, but they shouldn’t be able to physically confront suspects.

3) i don’t have a “hate boner”. i know what it feels like to be abused and i know what it feels like to have someone lie about you in an attempt to ruin your reputation, so yeah i’m taking this a bit personally. from what i’ve seen, i truly believe that amber’s story doesn’t add up and that she was in fact abusing him throughout their relationship. please, look into it yourself. i can even find the links for the transcripts if you don’t wanna google it yourself. johnny depp isn’t perfect — he’s definitely said some messed up stuff in his texts — but there’s a big difference between saying something gross in a text and physically/verbally abusing someone",t1_gctnai2,r/shittymoviedetails,resveries,2020-12-13 23:04:49+00:00,[{'display_url': 'https://www.youtube.com'}],Positive,Neutral,['https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg0C-N_MPYYOXyF4T3jMxNQ'],1

As for the original post.... her costars should care as should WB, especially considering he was set for his role in the HP film and when his lawyer petitioned to adjust the date for his case against amber in the states due to the filming schedule amber contacted WB personally which is outlined in court documents. Even before that their personal life effected his career and his charitable acts he lost his pirates role and he can’t even visit the children hospital that she lied about donating their divorce settlement to in costume as jack sparrow anymore.  

So yes, business is business but their personal life and her baseless accusations effected his career with nothing to back it up just her word.... which was her goal and clearly still is when she contacted WB.... why shouldn’t it effect hers??? Especially when it’s again her words, in addition to those of countless others including those closest to her, and everything she’s claimed has been proven to be a lie down to her stealing an assistants rape/DV story.....  then after Johnny gets dropped by WB she posts about how excited she is to start filming AM2 when a date hasn’t even been set to start filming almost as if she’s bragging they sided with her over him. 


This shows and goes over the court documents and Johnny being confirmed for the Harry Potter film he was just dropped from, request for changing the start date for the case against AH that hasn’t started yet in the states due to filming schedules for the Harry Potter film, and her contacting WB directly..... https://youtu.be/mUclMrpr6UU",t1_gebko9i,r/DCEUleaks,Swat4584,2020-12-16 10:31:04+00:00,[{'display_url': 'https://youtu.be'}],Positive,Negative,['https://youtu.be/mUclMrpr6UU'],1
