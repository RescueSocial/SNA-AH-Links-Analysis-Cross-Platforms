Johnny Depp, in 2013, texted his friend  “Let’s burn Amber. Let’s drown her before we burn her! I will fuck her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she is dead.”
Me and my bf were talking about famous male celebrities who have cheated on their partners. I said ""you can't trust any of them, first so and so and now johnny depp!"". My bf said what Depp said couldn't be grouped in with cheating and isn't as bad. He said they were just words, he could have been drunk, and we don't know what she said to deserve it. I pointed out that he said this while they were in a relationship and long before she had cheated or faked being hit by him and abused and there's nothing to excuse those words. I said I don't think it's ever ok to say that about your girlfriend, it's disturbing and disgusting. He doubled down that it's not as bad as cheating etc, and I said that I felt like if he could excuse what was said then he doesn't have much respect for women because no woman deserves that. He got very upset with me and an ugly argument ensued. 

As a side note, I obviously am aware of how abusive and awful amber was in the relationship, specially later into the relationship but the point of the argument was if what johnny said was as bad as cheating. I think it is and he doesn't. Who's in the wrong?

 I might be the asshole because I said that my boyfriend doesn't have any respect for women if he can defend what was said in that text.

Not until you link to paragraphs in the judgment about which you complain. Otherwise you are simply passing on things you have heard about - presumably on the internet - and asking me to respond. I can't. 

Assertions of yours such as:

>Why were the police, nurses, neighbours, makeup artists, witnesses, etc statements whether verbal or written, disregarded and Amber's the only one to be believed, regardless?

A) this is a libel case which doesn’t not mean that Depp is guilty of anything B) judges aren’t infallible, even judges know this which is why Courts of Appeals and Supreme Courts exist. Depp is appealing the decision, and has a strong argument for appeal, feel free to read it all yourself at www.nickwallis.com

Considering that you are basing your opinions on tabloid articles and allegations instead of the actual court documents and evidence, I would suggest that you are the one that most resembles Trump supporters. Unlike the election cases, Depp’s arguments were supported by actual evidence and eye witnesses. 

I reintegrate that my information is based on court document and evidence. The exact same evidence that the Judge in the article you reference looked at and ignored, and I know this because I read the ruling. The judge disregarded everything that Depp’s team submitted against Heard including:
- medical records
- photographic evidence
- police testimony
- independent building staff testimony
- and multiple other witnesses that contradicted her (including, in some cases, her own friends)

Reiterating the first answer, both seem to have been abusive. So yes the fight is really about how unfair society treats men who are domestically abused. 

there are videos like this https://youtu.be/PbXTr41ZFTQ
where they go into pretty in depth detail with some pretty interesting pieces of evidence on who was abusing who. 

also Amber Heard is just a shitty human. there are videos of her secretly recording interactions with Johnny where she purposely irritates him so he starts slamming cabinets and stuff. but he doesn't actually freak out on her.  https://youtu.be/V7lg69VFSY8",t3_kred8n,r/OutOfTheLoop,Ay_Mickay,2021-01-06 05:27:15+00:00,"[{'display_url': 'https://youtu.be'}, {'display_url': 'https://youtu.be'}]",Positive,Neutral,"['https://youtu.be/PbXTr41ZFTQ', 'https://youtu.be/V7lg69VFSY8']",2

It's so cute how all you have are insults,

since there is no tangible evidence

supporting Amber at all. Contrary to what

you think, a libel case in the UK doesn't

need evidence. The judge, who btw has

personal ties to the defendant and

therefore should never have ruled on that

case as it is a clear conflict of interest,

deemed it ""reasonably true"" based on

Amber's *verbal* testimony. Literally made

a ruling based on hearsay, and threw out

all of Johnny Depp's actual evidence.

The doctors who treated him for his finger

deny that it is at all possible for him to

have done it to himself. He basically lied

at the hospital to protect Amber, and there

is an audio tape of a physician confirming

that Amber did it, while Amber cries in the

background about how ""she didn't mean

to"".

Try again.

There is only one news article that I’m aware of, that really addresses Depp’s attempts to derail her career, and specifically his texts to that effect. That is the Hollywood Reporter article, which can be found [here](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/features/hes-radioactive-inside-johnny-depps-self-made-implosion).

Depp also admitted to hitting Heard at least a dozen times.  A few of them during blackout episodes he didn't even remember.

>According to the texts between Heard, Depp, and Depp’s assistant, Depp had blacked out and had no recollection of the kick. His assistant told him the next day. According to his assistant, Depp was “appalled” and “when I told him he kicked you, he cried”. The assistant went on to say, “it was disgusting and he knows it”.

>Depp later texted Heard to apologize personally and promise it would never happen again.

>Depp also texted Paul Bettany discussing how how he went too far with drugs and alcohol on that flight and he needed to cut back. He had also texted Bettany about being in a rage and blacked out in a text that can be found [here](https://amp.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/27/johnny-depp-amber-heard-threats-to-ex-wife-in-texts-london-high-court).

>Then, during the trial, Depp and the assistant changed their stories. They said that Depp hadn’t really hurt her, that it was a “playful tap”. He goes on to admit that he “may” have passed out in the bathroom on the trip, but denies blacking out.

|**[Comic Excerpt]**|Remember to also [properly source your excerpt](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_4._indicate_the_source_when_submitting_excerpts_or_artwork) with the issue # or the name of the trade in the title of your post.

Try to explain to them that many of their problems are caused by toxic masculinity, (which the right engages in far more willingly, especially the very people complaining about ""men's rights""), and many of them will retort with: ""What about toxic *femininity*""? Or somesuch nonsense.

Here's a screencap of something I saw a few days ago, to illustrate my point:

https://i.imgur.com/QX33B3h.png

To them, masculinity = good. Toxic is a word typically used to describe bad things. So if you use the term ""toxic masculinity"" you're calling masculinity bad, and because they believe they are masculine, you're calling *them bad*. It's all reptile brain shit, and they run with it.

But this post is in response to another post that’s going viral claiming she was fired, but also from a bad source. However, to quote one of my comments explaining it to a less condescending commenter: 

> [Screenrant](https://screenrant.com/wb-amber-heard-johnny-depp-aquaman-2-fire-different/) actually did a good analysis on this, one of the few actually good summaries I’ve seen from them. Essentially it boils down to the fact that the court of public opinion is not as powerful as the actual legal court system. The actual legal court system has precedent on the side of Heard, however unfair that may be, the result of this is that studios will not have a huge incentive to axe her from the film. The boycott has reached about two million supporters (of which I am one) but let’s be real, two million boycotters is a tiny number compared to the hundreds of millions who are still probably going to watch the movie. 

> The only way this could actually change is if Amber loses the Virginia case, which should ideally happen if the judge isn’t a personal friend of hers like justice Nichol. If she loses that case, then she’s much more likely to be axed, and I personally suspect the studio is quietly bringing her screen time down for this reason, because the court case would happen mid-filming, and if she was cut mid-filming, the impact to the movie can only be reduced by having reduced screen time for her character.",t1_gofpfxh,r/MensRights,Mycroft033,2021-02-23 07:00:28+00:00,[{'display_url': 'https://screenrant.com'}],Positive,Neutral,['https://screenrant.com/wb-amber-heard-johnny-depp-aquaman-2-fire-different/'],1

She just added a bunch of baggage about how “stupid” it was because she’s a shit human being. However she’s contractually obligated to be truthful about it, or at least in line with what the studio wants to say publicly. If she ends up getting axed later, awesome, but for now WB has basically stated that AH is still on for all intents and purposes.

Consider how the music was used in this film and compare it  to how music was used in GotG.  It's the same problem that CM had in establishing the character compared to how it they introduced Steve Rogers in CA. 

This video gives a good breakdown of that.

Just one example:

> The judge highlighted three incidents where he said Mr Depp had put Ms Heard in ""fear for her life"".

> In one of those incidents, in Australia in 2015, Mr Depp was allegedly physically and verbally abusive towards her while drinking heavily and taking drugs. Mr Depp accused Ms Heard of severing his finger, but the judge said he did not accept Ms Heard was responsible.

> ""Taking all the evidence together, I accept that she was the victim of sustained and multiple assaults by Mr Depp in Australia,"" said Mr Justice Nicol.


There is no explanation what this evidence actually is. I skipped the original court files to find the evidence, but other than Heards accusations and pictures she made of herself with bruises that are refuted by other witnesses like her make up artist saying she had no bruises, there is no real evidence at all.

And all the evidence (meaning the audio recordings Depp and Heard made) that is now publicly available shows the exact opposite.

Here is an audio that Head herself secretly recorded soon after the incident in which Depp lost his fingertip:

https://youtu.be/VDP9NVQmiXw

So we know that the judgement of the judge regarding this incident was clearly wrong. Heard was not only responsible for slicing his fingertip and crushing the bone. She is the one that doesn't want to leave because she fears Depp leaves her after that incident and the security staff working for Depp and her are mainly worried she will have another outburst if she stays.


But imo more important is this audio recording that Depp made. Depp speaks about several instances where she got violent with him (including Australia) while she downplays her violence and accuses him only of ""running away every single time"" they get into a fight:

https://youtu.be/aca0KWoHtqQ


In this recording, violence gets brought up several times by Depp, pleading with her to understand that he will remove himself from the situation when she has an outburst again and her ONLY argument is that he always runs away from fights even before she starts to get violent.


Considering all the evidence that is publicly available now it seems much more likely that Heard is the main and only abuser here that planned those allegations for some time because the relationship started to fall apart. 


For more reasons not to trust her, here is the hearing of Heard describing the alleged abuse:

https://youtu.be/X7PWjY8g3gk

I understand that victims of abuse can act in very different manners that seem counterintuitive to an abuse victim, but tbh, her actions here just seem laughable.

This has been [asked and answered](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/search?q=johnny+depp&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all) several times within the past year. [This answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/jq00sy/what_is_going_on_with_johnny_depp_innocent_memes/gbidmcn/) is probably the most accurate. There have been accusations by both Johnney Depp and Amber Heard against each other and, it seems, some proof for each of them that they abused each other. Amber Heard accused Depp of domestic abuse, and so people supported her. Then some info was released that seemed to support the idea that Heard was actually abusive towards Depp. So people supported Depp. A few months ago Depp sued the Sun tabloid for defamation b/c they said he abused Heard, but he lost that suit, which would support the idea that there was at least some proof to the Sun's words. So now some people support Heard, some support Depp, and honestly there's no way to know the truth right now especially since there hasn't been much info released for the past few months. [This BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-54506759) pretty much covers everything that's public knowledge at the moment. I'd be skeptical of anyone who claims that either Depp or Heard is 100% innocent and the other one is 100% guilty.

That seems to me to indicate there was some evidence that he is a wife beater which was found in court but not released to the public.

I'm not super familiar with the story between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, but I wouldn't necessarily draw this conclusion from Depp losing a libel case against a newspaper. 

IANAL but I know some stuff about this (although I am open to correction if I'm off base here given my shortcomings). when it comes to public figures, the bar for actually committing libel against them is pretty high. you have to show actual malice (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_malice). 

so essentially, you can't assume they found evidence he's a wife beater. I think it would be more reasonable to assume Depp wasn't able to show that the newspaper hated him, knew this info was wrong, didn't try to verify it at all, and printed it with the intent to harm him - which, even if all that happened, is hard to prove.",t3_lbflat,r/changemyview,cherrycokeicee,2021-02-03 04:57:03+00:00,[{'display_url': 'https://en.m.wikipedia.org'}],Negative,Negative,['https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_malice'],1

reddit,_doc,SVfmZnoBZsCJ_ScUUhLA,1.0,gm51f0g,t1_gm51f0g,/r/AskReddit/comments/k6wtmu/feminists_of_reddit_what_is_your_opinion_on_the/gm51f0g/,"*ETA, according to the cited articles, Amber was allegedly aware and consented to being recorded in the below referenced audio recordings between her and Depp. 

I consider myself a feminist but with everything I know about their accusations I don’t believe a word Amber Heard says...that’s my opinion anyways. There is an unknown number of legitimately abused women who suffer in silence and public accusations may give them the courage to come forward, but false accusations can also hurt real victims as well.  For me, the most telling piece of evidence is the recorded conversations between Johnny and Amber.  Now it seems that Johnny may have known that they were being recorded and Amber may not have so Johnny may be a little careful with what he says.  Regardless, Amber’s words and demeanor just don’t strike me as a woman who is being abused and fearful of her abuser.  In the recordings she admits to hitting him and says something to the effect of not being able to promise she won’t get physical again..that she gets so angry she loses it.  That statement right there indicates that she is aware of her behavior but tries to justify it under the guise of not being able to control herself. I work in a field where I regularly deal with victims of domestic violence. Women who are abused are usually fearful of their abusers and feel like they have to walk on eggshells to not enrage them, and every perceived slight from the abuser leads to them lashing out at their victim, whether the slight is only imagined or not. I’m not saying that all abused women don’t fight back, but the overwhelming majority of long time domestic violence victims don’t threaten their abuser with physical violence...particularly women who are smaller and weaker then a male partner.  Now those recordings in themselves are enough to make me believe that Amber is not a victim and at the very least, they’re mutual combatants in a violent and tumultuous relationship. However when you add other known factors in, it leads me to believe that not only is Amber not a victim, but she may actually be an abuser.  

Amber was previously arrested for allegedly assaulting her ex girlfriend in a public place, in plain view of police officers. She was observed allegedly striking the woman, grabbing her arm, and ripping a necklace off her neck. THOSE are the actions of an abuser. And if that was how she treated her in public, I can only imagine how she acts behind closed doors, particularly if alcohol or drugs are involved.  Now to be fair, her ex denied the allegations and the charges were dropped and later, at Amber’s (or her attorneys) request, deleted from the system...But Amber’s ex could be reacting as an abuse victim...protecting her abuser, denying allegations, and blaming others (in this case the police officers who saw the incident and stepped in).  I believe Amber and her ex may have even tried to claim that the officers were homophobic and misogynistic, but I think one of the officers came forward and stated that she was a lesbian and feminist and denied their allegations of prejudice.  Once again abusers will blame their victims and others for their actions and the victim will often protect them...I’ve seen it so many times speaking to DV victims who swear their partner didn’t hurt them while they have visible bruises on their face and body. That is THE reason a lot of states enacted mandatory  domestic violence arrest laws where officers can make an arrest even if the victim is being uncooperative or denying abuse when the officer has reason to believe the abuse occurred (I.e black eyes, bruises, etc).  So now not only do you have her own words saying she can’t control herself, but you have an instance of past abuse allegations that was allegedly witnessed in a public place by police officers.  On the contrary, all of Johnny’s exes claim he was never abusive with them and even provided written statements saying as such. While I wouldn’t necessarily take their word for it, there’s witnesses who claim they saw Amber abusing a partner, and none (other than Amber’s sister who she allegedly also abused) that saw Johnny abusing Amber.  She’s also changed dates when confronted with evidence that proved she wasn’t injured in the form of photographs and witness testimony.  And when she changed those dates, her one and only witness, her sister, also changed the dates.  All of the people that were close to Amber and Johnny as a couple also claimed that Amber was the abuser. Not a single person who came forward (once again w the exception of Amber’s sister) said they saw Johnny ever be violent towards Amber, but most of them said that Amber was violent with him.  This includes Amber’s own former personal assistant.  As I stated, the only reason I even care about these celebrities or their civil suits and allegations is because I’m a strong advocate for women’s rights and holding domestic violence abusers accountable for their actions. But when women who aren’t victims claim they are, they risk real victims not being believed.  I think another allegation that speaks towards Amber’s character is claiming a rape that happened to one of her employees was her own experience. If that’s true that is absolutely abhorrent to me. 

These suits are being handled in civil courts. The burden of proof in civil courts is not nearly as high as the burden of proof in criminal courts. In criminal cases it’s beyond a reasonable doubt, in civil cases it’s a preponderance of the evidence.  That means if the jury or judge believes that there’s a 51% chance the allegations are true and a 49% chance they’re not, they will rule in their favor.  Civil court is a joke imo and I put zero stock into their rulings.  So regardless of what happens between the two of them in court, no matter who the rulings favor, that in no way is truly indicative of the truth.  I believe Johnny lost the initial suit against the Sun.  The Sun made like 14 allegations of abuse against Depp citing only Amber’s allegations.  The judge only had to believe that ONE of the 14 allegations could be true...that is an insane standard to beat, especially when you’re only going off of one parties word.  IMO Amber seems like a manipulative and unhinged person and I just don’t believe her.  I don’t believe Depp is 100% innocent for that matter, but I do believe that Amber was the primary emotional and physical aggressor and the abusive party.  You can hear it in the recordings from her own words.  She puts Depp down insinuating he’s old and fat and then refuses to take any responsibility for her physical aggression, instead insisting that Depp is responsible for her actions because he doesn’t stay around to endure her abuse.  I’m sure I’m going to get a lot of heat on this thread for my comment but it’s what I truly believe based on my experience.  I’m including links to some articles, I know they aren’t all the most reliable sources, but celebrity gossip and civil allegations aren’t often covered by the MSM.

Thats not a generalization. Thats a fact. In domestic violence disputes, Men are more likely to abuse their female partners. Women are more likely to be victims of domestic violence in general. Just google the statistics.

>She did stand up for Johnny here, but that sole portion of her statement basically says that in other situations, she will continue to generalize and assume that the women is the victim these scenarios.

Assume yes, generalize no, because statistically women are more often the victims. Also I dont think you are using the term generalize correctly here. To generalize is to make a broad statement about the majority based on the minority. A generalization, for example, is saying that ""all men are abusers"", but she isn't saying that. She's saying that in domestic violence disputes the women are most often the victims amd this is a correct statement, thus not a generalization. 

>Just as many men are using Johnny as a martyr right now to suggest that a majority of men may be innocent, she basically stated that despite this case the majority of men are not. That would be an extreme.

That is correct, because as stated before, women are statistically more likely to be the victim in these cases.

That's a misconception.  
Majority of studies just assume that domestic violence has a ""direction"" and that it goes from men towards women.  
Also they are usually backed financially by feminists so there's a clear conflict of interest there(why they only look at situations where men are aggressors).  
There's not much independent studies that actually take both ""directions"" into consideration.  
But when they do, this happens(citing the study) :

"" In recent years researchers have approached populations **without preconceptions as to the direction of violence**. Large epidemiological studies have demonstrated that **domestic violence is most commonly reciprocal** and that when **only one partner is violent there is an excess of violent women**. Whitaker et al, 2 in a study of 14 000 young US couples aged 18-28 years, found that 24% of relationships had some violence and half of those were reciprocally violent. **In 70% of the non-reciprocally violent relationships women were the perpetrators of violence**. ""

[https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C5432B0C6F8F61B49A4E2B60B931FA07/S175832090000620Xa.pdf/domestic\_violence\_is\_most\_commonly\_reciprocal.pdf](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C5432B0C6F8F61B49A4E2B60B931FA07/S175832090000620Xa.pdf/domestic_violence_is_most_commonly_reciprocal.pdf)

So basically, in majority of cases of domestic violence, the other party is not just an innocent victim, since in majority of cases it's reciprocal (both partners are violent/abusive towards each other).  
BUT when there's only 1 partner that is being violent in that relationship, it's usually a woman who is the abuser ( 70% vs 30% ).

But this is nothing new, this goes back at least 50 years ago too, here you can read about what **a woman that started first shelter for women ever** went through because some women(mostly feminists) didn't want this to be heard(reciprocity of domestic violence) :  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin\_Pizzey#Refuge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Pizzey#Refuge)

So as you can see, most men who are victims just suffer in silence since they don't get any help, not even close to the level of help that they need.

You don't have to watch the videos I link, I put them there because I referenced them in case you wanted to watch.

Would you discredit a journalist because they get paid to report the news as well? I don't think your argument about how she is ""charging"" people tracks. You're entitled to your opinion about why an abuse victim would be an unreliable source, though I also disagree with that perspective.

All I'm saying is that this case is not black and white. I believe Amber Heard was abusive to Johnny Depp, but that doesn't mean that she couldn't have also been treated poorly by him. In my opinion, it looks like it was just an all around toxic relationship.

I do not, however, agree with either of them losing work or facing other repercussions (such as being called a ""wife beater"") until the case is closed. It is unfair and goes against the entire idea of being innocent until proven guilty. Both of them deserve a fair trial. Neither of them deserve to be labelled, mocked, or cancelled based on allegations that have not been definitively proven in a fair trial.

>Depp also texted Paul Bettany discussing how how he went too far with drugs and alcohol on that flight and he needed to cut back. He had also texted Bettany about being in a rage and blacked out in a text that can be found here.

“I have found that the great majority of alleged assaults of Ms Heard by Mr Depp have been proved to the civil standard,” said Nicol. “The claimant has not succeeded in his action for libel.”

The judge ruled Depp's feelings towards his wife during their turbulent three-year relationship were summed up in a text where the actor revealed he had ""no mercy"" for her.

He also concluded Depp beat Ms Heard 12 times - starting in 2013 when he slapped the actress when she made a comment about his tattoo.

Over the course of their stormy marriage, the judge found Depp battered his wife after flying into drug and booze-fuelled rages.

But he dismissed two allegations made by Ms Heard in 2014 and 2015.

The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.” 

Here's the full link: https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/updated-definition-rape

Canada is a bit different, because we have sexual assaults levels, and forced penetration is included within the worst category, Level 3, but is considered it's own charge within that. 

For fun, I looked up Sweden, because I could: Historically, rape has been defined as forced sexual intercourse initiated against a woman or man by one or several people, without consent. In recent years, several revisions to the definition of rape have been made to the law of Sweden, to include not only intercourse but also comparable sexual acts against someone incapable of giving consent, due to being in a vulnerable situation, such as a state of fear or unconsciousness.

Now I did look up the UK definition, and it does specify penis. So you're both right and wrong. You're right in the sense that your tiny island has a flaw in its legal system. You're wrong in the sense that the rest of the western world necessarily follows this distinction. 

So get off your high horse, Lawyer Lady, because lots of other places have different laws about this, which means that this Depp/Heard case, which does not take place in the UK, is inherently subjected to different legalities.",t1_gpnswhm,r/TrueOffMyChest,BalonSwann07,2021-03-04 20:33:41+00:00,[{'display_url': 'https://www.justice.gov'}],Positive,Negative,['https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/updated-definition-rape'],1

US law is a state by state mismatched mess. There is no federal definition of rape, however there are some states that have definitions that define rape in a retrograde manner - ie without reference to a penis. It’s a bit like the states that allow 12 year old rape female victims to be married to their rapists, or don’t criminalise beastiality. 

That said, I’m not expert in US law so I bow to your afternoon of Google research :) 

You guys have travelled a long way from the origins of your law (ie an abrogation of British law) 

I’m slightly confused as to why you’ve identified the Canadian system when it is exactly comparable to the offences of enforced penetration etc in UK law, (sexual offences act 2003) which forms the basis of a whole range of international law in commonwealth countries and beyond. 

Well done for identifying Sweden, which I don’t know in depth. You’ll note that I didn’t state that all countries had the same definition, and you’ve picked Sweden as the exception to the rule. They have quite a progressive stance on stealthing for instance, which they enacted a roughly the same time. That’s commendable as a recognition of the different impact of male perpetrated sexual assault. The UK are far behind unfortunately. 

There is a difference between the law and the practice however. There’s a significant gender split in victimisation for sexual offences still - 6% of women self report as victims of sexual assault in the year 2018, for instance. compared to less then 1% of men. Somewhere buried within the document will be a figure relating to the gender of the perpetrator, which will be almost exclusively male, although it’s half eleven at night and I don’t have time to find the information for you. I also suspect that it would be an illuminating experience for you, and definitely more effective than me just telling you. You might also want to look tk the gendered prosecution rates, ie how many women are perpetrating sexual crimes, as prosecuted by the state. You’ll again, find that figure illuminating. 

 https://www.bra.se/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/swedish-crime-survey.html

I am pleased you’ve bothered doing the research though. 

I want to point you toward a few extra documents on the gendered nature of sexual crime and rape, from the UN, but also from some criminologists specifically relating to domestic abuse.

And although Wikipedia clearly isn’t an appropriate source, it does often do the work for you, and if you check the reference list you should find a whole range of reading on the international law of rape. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_framework_of_sexual_violence

Also just to state - one of the two pieces of the JD/AH litigation was absolutely under British jurisdiction. British legal principles provide the basis of most of international and domestic law across the world. You’ve struggled all day to find a couple of exceptions there - so well done.

Way better than the fugly HG cheated on her with but still.

This guy had anger issues and beat all his wives. The therapist was your average beta nice guy. He said that while he would never want to be an abusive guy, he was saddened by the fact that his patient's romantic life was better by comparison. Why would an asshole keep getting interest from women but someone who wants to be a decent human being is struggling to get a date?

Here’s a list of things she’s admitted to or things we know: 

1) Apologizing to Depp during marriage counseling saying ‘I’m sorry for slapping you across the face but I was hitting you, I didn’t punch you babe. I don’t know what the actual movement of my hand was but you’re fine, I was hitting you babe, not punching’ 

2) She’s quoted by saying ‘you poke an animal enough, it is eventually, it doesn’t matter how friendly it is, not cool’ 

3) She threw glass bottles at him after he asked her to sign a pre-nup, which led to one shattering and severing his finger in the process 

4) After an altercation involving each other where Depp left, he told her he couldn’t take the physical abuse they were putting on one another, and Heard responded with ‘I can’t promise you I won’t get physical again. God I fucking sometimes get so mad I lose it’. 

Here’s the source for those incidents: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7947733/amp/Amber-Heard-admits-hitting-ex-husband-Johnny-Depp-pelting-pots-pans-tape.html

5) There is supposedly police body cam evidence that shows Amber and Johnny’s house wasn’t destroyed on the night she said he destroyed it in a fit of rage. This one hasn’t been confirmed yet, but I don’t see why it wouldn’t be true (here’s the source: https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2566055/johnny-depp-lawyer-claim-amber-heard-friends-lied-body-cam-footage) 

6) here’s another one where she tells Depp during a fight that she’s gonna tell police he abused her and that ‘no one will believe him because he’s a man’ (Source: https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/amber-heard-told-johnny-depp-victim/) 

There are more incidents, including her shitting in their bed, but that’s all I got for now. 

It’s really important that you can take a look at these. I hope you see from these that Heard isn’t innocent, and absolutely was an abuser here. Saying that they were both guilty isn’t the ‘simplistic’ explanation, it’s the one that takes more nuance to understand.

* Unlike most accused abusers, Johnny was open about his substance abuse and anger issues, and was doing his part to change.

* Many celebrities in hollywood came out to defend him, including not one, but TWO of his ex wives. A sizeable portion of those who took his side were women who worked with him directly too.

* [Depp has audio recordings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiuUzvZMyro) (recorded by AMBER, btw) of the things she said to  him during one of her arguments. As well as a slew of other evidence that he began stockpiling from the moments the accusations went public. Now, this body cam footage as well.

* Depp's finger was cut by Amber throwing a bottle at him. She has not countered that claim.

* Depp has actively gone out of his way to prove his innocence with recordings, and testimonies from others whereas Amber has pretty much made it this far on accusations alone. 

The reason why so many of us are pissed about this is because the lens through which this is being viewed is highly imbalanced. How much more does he have to give to get even a benefit of a doubt?

Justice Nichol put more weight on AH and her friends as witnesses and disregarded Depp's police, medical evidence and independent witnesses (one being Heard's personal assistant who claimed AH abused her & her son too - along with stealing her own rape story).

Edit: Okay. Let's take on a couple of those instances:

1: Whitney Heard told her boss, Jennifer Howell, that it was in fact Amber Heard who was abusing Depp and that she thought Amber was going to kill him one day. 

Quote: She said: “Whitney testified about a violent incident in 2015. Whitney said she had to go live with her employer, where she had to sleep on their floor. I am that employer. This is not what I was told to be true. Whitney came to live in the guest room, not on my floor. Whitney told me she tried to stop Amber from attacking Johnny.

“Whitney said when she tried to intervene, Amber nearly pushed Whitney down the stairs. She told me she was worried Amber ‘was going to kill Johnny’.”

She filed for it for a reason and now the world can see it does not match up with her ever-evolving/changing statements.

""The discovery request from the LAPD is everything that the police have on file regarding a May altercation between Heard and Depp that led to Heard receiving a restraining order against Depp. Depp has long claimed that all altercations in their marriage were Heard's fault, so the police files on these incidents would be a big boon to Heard if they support her version of events and not Depp's take on things. Interestingly, Heard's team is also asking the police for ""“all documents and communications of any nature with Mr. Depp, and/or any of Mr. Depp’s agents, attorneys or others acting on his behalf, from May 21, 2016 through the present,"" suggesting that they believe that Depp or his lawyers have tried to contact the police themselves since that incident.""

""He immediately stood up from our shared seat on the edge of a planter bench and went over to Brooks to stand up for the woman,"" Danoff says. ""Mr. Depp said to Mr. Brooks, 'You can’t talk to her like that. You think she is something less than you? Who do you think you are? How dare you?'""

Danoff says there were no punches thrown and no offer of $100,000 for Brooks to punch Depp — and she says she has 40 time-stamped photos that prove it.""

* epistemic innocence, the status of whether we (who have no special ties to a case) are entitled to believe whether the defendant did the crime; and 
* innocence as a matter of truth, whether the defendant did the crime; 

A person who is *not* innocent as a matter of truth, because they did a criminal act, is epistemically innocent until proven otherwise in a criminal court.

OJ remains epistemically innocent of murder even though, by the lights of the civil court, it is more likely than not that he did the crime. For his presumption of epistemic innocence is preserved (with respect to that crime) until conviction in a criminal court.

(Your omitted link: https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/acquittal)
>  An acquittal signifies that a prosecutor failed to prove his or her case beyond a reasonable doubt, not that a defendant is innocent.

This is false. It is generally true the upon acquittal a defendant's presumption of innocence is preserved, as when the prosecutor fails to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt. Sometimes, however, an alibi, or other evidence, might arise for the defendant that proves their innocence as a matter of truth. In that case too, the defendant will be acquitted. 

In either case a verdict of ""Not guilty"" amounts to preserving that the defendant is epistemically innocent. That is, either because the presumption of innocence is preserved; or because their innocence is proved.

And we could just as well use ""innocent"" in the place of ""not guilty"", as short for a finding that ""the defendant is epistemically innocent, whether by preservation of presumption or proof"".

""Depp is expected to testify that he did not hit Brooks, but rather confronted him verbally after he saw Brooks acting belligerently toward a woman on set. Depp’s attorneys have also argued in pre-trial briefs that there is no evidence suggesting that Depp had any hand in preventing Brooks from getting work.""

Also, it was a freakin movie set. Depp has eyewitnesses and time-stamped media proving his case:
“After all the evidence from multiple sworn eyewitness testimony and dozens of contemporaneous photographs taken by the script supervisor, Mr. Brooks has finally found a single witness to support his absurd, delusional claim — his own lawyer,” Waldman said. “As soon as the evidence defeats Mr. Brooks in trial we will immediately launch malicious prosecution claims against his attorneys.
