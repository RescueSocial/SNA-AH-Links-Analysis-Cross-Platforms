[This answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/jq00sy/what_is_going_on_with_johnny_depp_innocent_memes/gbidmcn/) is probably the most accurate. There have been accusations by both Johnney Depp and Amber Heard against each other and, it seems, some proof for each of them that they abused each other. Amber Heard accused Depp of domestic abuse, and so people supported her. Then some info was released that seemed to support the idea that Heard was actually abusive towards Depp. So people supported Depp. A few months ago Depp sued the Sun tabloid for defamation b/c they said he abused Heard, but he lost that suit, which would support the idea that there was at least some proof to the Sun's words. So now some people support Heard, some support Depp, and honestly there's no way to know the truth right now especially since there hasn't been much info released for the past few months. [This BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-54506759) pretty much covers everything that's public knowledge at the moment.

       "\n",
       "I consider myself a feminist but with everything I know about their accusations I don’t believe a word Amber Heard says...that’s my opinion anyways. There is an unknown number of legitimately abused women who suffer in silence and public accusations may give them the courage to come forward, but false accusations can also hurt real victims as well.  For me, the most telling piece of evidence is the recorded conversations between Johnny and Amber.  Now it seems that Johnny may have known that they were being recorded and Amber may not have so Johnny may be a little careful with what he says.  Regardless, Amber’s words and demeanor just don’t strike me as a woman who is being abused and fearful of her abuser.  In the recordings she admits to hitting him and says something to the effect of not being able to promise she won’t get physical again..that she gets so angry she loses it.  That statement right there indicates that she is aware of her behavior but tries to justify it under the guise of not being able to control herself. I work in a field where I regularly deal with victims of domestic violence. Women who are abused are usually fearful of their abusers and feel like they have to walk on eggshells to not enrage them, and every perceived slight from the abuser leads to them lashing out at their victim, whether the slight is only imagined or not. I’m not saying that all abused women don’t fight back, but the overwhelming majority of long time domestic violence victims don’t threaten their abuser with physical violence...particularly women who are smaller and weaker then a male partner.  Now those recordings in themselves are enough to make me believe that Amber is not a victim and at the very least, they’re mutual combatants in a violent and tumultuous relationship. However when you add other known factors in, it leads me to believe that not only is Amber not a victim, but she may actually be an abuser.  \n",
       "\n",
       "Amber was previously arrested for allegedly assaulting her ex girlfriend in a public place, in plain view of police officers. She was observed allegedly striking the woman, grabbing her arm, and ripping a necklace off her neck. THOSE are the actions of an abuser. And if that was how she treated her in public, I can only imagine how she acts behind closed doors, particularly if alcohol or drugs are involved.  Now to be fair, her ex denied the allegations and the charges were dropped and later, at Amber’s (or her attorneys) request, deleted from the system...But Amber’s ex could be reacting as an abuse victim...protecting her abuser, denying allegations, and blaming others (in this case the police officers who saw the incident and stepped in).  I believe Amber and her ex may have even tried to claim that the officers were homophobic and misogynistic, but I think one of the officers came forward and stated that she was a lesbian and feminist and denied their allegations of prejudice.  Once again abusers will blame their victims and others for their actions and the victim will often protect them...I’ve seen it so many times speaking to DV victims who swear their partner didn’t hurt them while they have visible bruises on their face and body. That is THE reason a lot of states enacted mandatory  domestic violence arrest laws where officers can make an arrest even if the victim is being uncooperative or denying abuse when the officer has reason to believe the abuse occurred (I.e black eyes, bruises, etc).  So now not only do you have her own words saying she can’t control herself, but you have an instance of past abuse allegations that was allegedly witnessed in a public place by police officers.  On the contrary, all of Johnny’s exes claim he was never abusive with them and even provided written statements saying as such. While I wouldn’t necessarily take their word for it, there’s witnesses who claim they saw Amber abusing a partner, and none (other than Amber’s sister who she allegedly also abused) that saw Johnny abusing Amber.  She’s also changed dates when confronted with evidence that proved she wasn’t injured in the form of photographs and witness testimony.  And when she changed those dates, her one and only witness, her sister, also changed the dates.  All of the people that were close to Amber and Johnny as a couple also claimed that Amber was the abuser. Not a single person who came forward (once again w the exception of Amber’s sister) said they saw Johnny ever be violent towards Amber, but most of them said that Amber was violent with him.  This includes Amber’s own former personal assistant.  As I stated, the only reason I even care about these celebrities or their civil suits and allegations is because I’m a strong advocate for women’s rights and holding domestic violence abusers accountable for their actions. But when women who aren’t victims claim they are, they risk real victims not being believed.  I think another allegation that speaks towards Amber’s character is claiming a rape that happened to one of her employees was her own experience. If that’s true that is absolutely abhorrent to me. \n",
       "\n",
       "These suits are being handled in civil courts. The burden of proof in civil courts is not nearly as high as the burden of proof in criminal courts. In criminal cases it’s beyond a reasonable doubt, in civil cases it’s a preponderance of the evidence.  That means if the jury or judge believes that there’s a 51% chance the allegations are true and a 49% chance they’re not, they will rule in their favor.  Civil court is a joke imo and I put zero stock into their rulings.  So regardless of what happens between the two of them in court, no matter who the rulings favor, that in no way is truly indicative of the truth.  I believe Johnny lost the initial suit against the Sun.  The Sun made like 14 allegations of abuse against Depp citing only Amber’s allegations.  The judge only had to believe that ONE of the 14 allegations could be true...that is an insane standard to beat, especially when you’re only going off of one parties word.  IMO Amber seems like a manipulative and unhinged person and I just don’t believe her.  I don’t believe Depp is 100% innocent for that matter, but I do believe that Amber was the primary emotional and physical aggressor and the abusive party.  You can hear it in the recordings from her own words.  She puts Depp down insinuating he’s old and fat and then refuses to take any responsibility for her physical aggression, instead insisting that Depp is responsible for her actions because he doesn’t stay around to endure her abuse.  I’m sure I’m going to get a lot of heat on this thread for my comment but it’s what I truly believe based on my experience.  I’m including links to some articles, I know they aren’t all the most reliable sources, but celebrity gossip and civil allegations aren’t often covered by the MSM.\n",

       "I consider myself a feminist but with everything I know about their accusations I don’t believe a word Amber Heard says...that’s my opinion anyways. There is an unknown number of legitimately abused women who suffer in silence and public accusations may give them the courage to come forward, but false accusations can also hurt real victims as well.  For me, the most telling piece of evidence is the recorded conversations between Johnny and Amber.  Now it seems that Johnny may have known that they were being recorded and Amber may not have so Johnny may be a little careful with what he says.  Regardless, Amber’s words and demeanor just don’t strike me as a woman who is being abused and fearful of her abuser.  In the recordings she admits to hitting him and says something to the effect of not being able to promise she won’t get physical again..that she gets so angry she loses it.  That statement right there indicates that she is aware of her behavior but tries to justify it under the guise of not being able to control herself. I work in a field where I regularly deal with victims of domestic violence. Women who are abused are usually fearful of their abusers and feel like they have to walk on eggshells to not enrage them, and every perceived slight from the abuser leads to them lashing out at their victim, whether the slight is only imagined or not. I’m not saying that all abused women don’t fight back, but the overwhelming majority of long time domestic violence victims don’t threaten their abuser with physical violence...particularly women who are smaller and weaker then a male partner.  Now those recordings in themselves are enough to make me believe that Amber is not a victim and at the very least, they’re mutual combatants in a violent and tumultuous relationship. However when you add other known factors in, it leads me to believe that not only is Amber not a victim, but she may actually be an abuser.  \n",

       "Amber was previously arrested for allegedly assaulting her ex girlfriend in a public place, in plain view of police officers. She was observed allegedly striking the woman, grabbing her arm, and ripping a necklace off her neck. THOSE are the actions of an abuser. And if that was how she treated her in public, I can only imagine how she acts behind closed doors, particularly if alcohol or drugs are involved.  Now to be fair, her ex denied the allegations and the charges were dropped and later, at Amber’s (or her attorneys) request, deleted from the system...But Amber’s ex could be reacting as an abuse victim...protecting her abuser, denying allegations, and blaming others (in this case the police officers who saw the incident and stepped in).  I believe Amber and her ex may have even tried to claim that the officers were homophobic and misogynistic, but I think one of the officers came forward and stated that she was a lesbian and feminist and denied their allegations of prejudice.  Once again abusers will blame their victims and others for their actions and the victim will often protect them...I’ve seen it so many times speaking to DV victims who swear their partner didn’t hurt them while they have visible bruises on their face and body. That is THE reason a lot of states enacted mandatory  domestic violence arrest laws where officers can make an arrest even if the victim is being uncooperative or denying abuse when the officer has reason to believe the abuse occurred (I.e black eyes, bruises, etc).  So now not only do you have her own words saying she can’t control herself, but you have an instance of past abuse allegations that was allegedly witnessed in a public place by police officers.  On the contrary, all of Johnny’s exes claim he was never abusive with them and even provided written statements saying as such. While I wouldn’t necessarily take their word for it, there’s witnesses who claim they saw Amber abusing a partner, and none (other than Amber’s sister who she allegedly also abused) that saw Johnny abusing Amber.  She’s also changed dates when confronted with evidence that proved she wasn’t injured in the form of photographs and witness testimony.  And when she changed those dates, her one and only witness, her sister, also changed the dates.  All of the people that were close to Amber and Johnny as a couple also claimed that Amber was the abuser. Not a single person who came forward (once again w the exception of Amber’s sister) said they saw Johnny ever be violent towards Amber, but most of them said that Amber was violent with him.  This includes Amber’s own former personal assistant.  As I stated, the only reason I even care about these celebrities or their civil suits and allegations is because I’m a strong advocate for women’s rights and holding domestic violence abusers accountable for their actions. But when women who aren’t victims claim they are, they risk real victims not being believed.  I think another allegation that speaks towards Amber’s character is claiming a rape that happened to one of her employees was her own experience. If that’s true that is absolutely abhorrent to me. \n",

I’m not saying that all abused women don’t fight back, but the overwhelming majority of long time domestic violence victims don’t threaten their abuser with physical violence...particularly women who are smaller and weaker then a male partner.

       "Amber was previously arrested for allegedly assaulting her ex girlfriend in a public place, in plain view of police officers. She was observed allegedly striking the woman, grabbing her arm, and ripping a necklace off her neck. THOSE are the actions of an abuser. And if that was how she treated her in public, I can only imagine how she acts behind closed doors, particularly if alcohol or drugs are involved.  Now to be fair, her ex denied the allegations and the charges were dropped and later, at Amber’s (or her attorneys) request, deleted from the system...But Amber’s ex could be reacting as an abuse victim...protecting her abuser, denying allegations, and blaming others (in this case the police officers who saw the incident and stepped in).  I believe Amber and her ex may have even tried to claim that the officers were homophobic and misogynistic, but I think one of the officers came forward and stated that she was a lesbian and feminist and denied their allegations of prejudice.  Once again abusers will blame their victims and others for their actions and the victim will often protect them...I’ve seen it so many times speaking to DV victims who swear their partner didn’t hurt them while they have visible bruises on their face and body. That is THE reason a lot of states enacted mandatory  domestic violence arrest laws where officers can make an arrest even if the victim is being uncooperative or denying abuse when the officer has reason to believe the abuse occurred (I.e black eyes, bruises, etc).  So now not only do you have her own words saying she can’t control herself, but you have an instance of past abuse allegations that was allegedly witnessed in a public place by police officers.  On the contrary, all of Johnny’s exes claim he was never abusive with them and even provided written statements saying as such. While I wouldn’t necessarily take their word for it, there’s witnesses who claim they saw Amber abusing a partner, and none (other than Amber’s sister who she allegedly also abused) that saw Johnny abusing Amber.  She’s also changed dates when confronted with evidence that proved she wasn’t injured in the form of photographs and witness testimony.  And when she changed those dates, her one and only witness, her sister, also changed the dates.  All of the people that were close to Amber and Johnny as a couple also claimed that Amber was the abuser. Not a single person who came forward (once again w the exception of Amber’s sister) said they saw Johnny ever be violent towards Amber, but most of them said that Amber was violent with him.  This includes Amber’s own former personal assistant.  As I stated, the only reason I even care about these celebrities or their civil suits and allegations is because I’m a strong advocate for women’s rights and holding domestic violence abusers accountable for their actions. But when women who aren’t victims claim they are, they risk real victims not being believed.  I think another allegation that speaks towards Amber’s character is claiming a rape that happened to one of her employees was her own experience.

       "I consider myself a feminist but with everything I know about their accusations I don’t believe a word Amber Heard says...that’s my opinion anyways. There is an unknown number of legitimately abused women who suffer in silence and public accusations may give them the courage to come forward, but false accusations can also hurt real victims as well.  For me, the most telling piece of evidence is the recorded conversations between Johnny and Amber.  Now it seems that Johnny may have known that they were being recorded and Amber may not have so Johnny may be a little careful with what he says.  Regardless, Amber’s words and demeanor just don’t strike me as a woman who is being abused and fearful of her abuser.  In the recordings she admits to hitting him and says something to the effect of not being able to promise she won’t get physical again..that she gets so angry she loses it.  That statement right there indicates that she is aware of her behavior but tries to justify it under the guise of not being able to control herself. I work in a field where I regularly deal with victims of domestic violence. Women who are abused are usually fearful of their abusers and feel like they have to walk on eggshells to not enrage them, and every perceived slight from the abuser leads to them lashing out at their victim, whether the slight is only imagined or not. I’m not saying that all abused women don’t fight back, but the overwhelming majority of long time domestic violence victims don’t threaten their abuser with physical violence...particularly women who are smaller and weaker then a male partner.  Now those recordings in themselves are enough to make me believe that Amber is not a victim and at the very least, they’re mutual combatants in a violent and tumultuous relationship. However when you add other known factors in, it leads me to believe that not only is Amber not a victim, but she may actually be an abuser.  \n",
       "\n",
       "Amber was previously arrested for allegedly assaulting her ex girlfriend in a public place, in plain view of police officers. She was observed allegedly striking the woman, grabbing her arm, and ripping a necklace off her neck. THOSE are the actions of an abuser. And if that was how she treated her in public, I can only imagine how she acts behind closed doors, particularly if alcohol or drugs are involved.  Now to be fair, her ex denied the allegations and the charges were dropped and later, at Amber’s (or her attorneys) request, deleted from the system...But Amber’s ex could be reacting as an abuse victim...protecting her abuser, denying allegations, and blaming others (in this case the police officers who saw the incident and stepped in).  I believe Amber and her ex may have even tried to claim that the officers were homophobic and misogynistic, but I think one of the officers came forward and stated that she was a lesbian and feminist and denied their allegations of prejudice.  Once again abusers will blame their victims and others for their actions and the victim will often protect them...I’ve seen it so many times speaking to DV victims who swear their partner didn’t hurt them while they have visible bruises on their face and body. That is THE reason a lot of states enacted mandatory  domestic violence arrest laws where officers can make an arrest even if the victim is being uncooperative or denying abuse when the officer has reason to believe the abuse occurred (I.e black eyes, bruises, etc).  So now not only do you have her own words saying she can’t control herself, but you have an instance of past abuse allegations that was allegedly witnessed in a public place by police officers.  On the contrary, all of Johnny’s exes claim he was never abusive with them and even provided written statements saying as such. While I wouldn’t necessarily take their word for it, there’s witnesses who claim they saw Amber abusing a partner, and none (other than Amber’s sister who she allegedly also abused) that saw Johnny abusing Amber.  She’s also changed dates when confronted with evidence that proved she wasn’t injured in the form of photographs and witness testimony.  And when she changed those dates, her one and only witness, her sister, also changed the dates.  All of the people that were close to Amber and Johnny as a couple also claimed that Amber was the abuser. Not a single person who came forward (once again w the exception of Amber’s sister) said they saw Johnny ever be violent towards Amber, but most of them said that Amber was violent with him.  This includes Amber’s own former personal assistant.  As I stated, the only reason I even care about these celebrities or their civil suits and allegations is because I’m a strong advocate for women’s rights and holding domestic violence abusers accountable for their actions. But when women who aren’t victims claim they are, they risk real victims not being believed.  I think another allegation that speaks towards Amber’s character is claiming a rape that happened to one of her employees was her own experience. If that’s true that is absolutely abhorrent to me. \n",

       "These suits are being handled in civil courts. The burden of proof in civil courts is not nearly as high as the burden of proof in criminal courts. In criminal cases it’s beyond a reasonable doubt, in civil cases it’s a preponderance of the evidence.  That means if the jury or judge believes that there’s a 51% chance the allegations are true and a 49% chance they’re not, they will rule in their favor.  Civil court is a joke imo and I put zero stock into their rulings.  So regardless of what happens between the two of them in court, no matter who the rulings favor, that in no way is truly indicative of the truth.  I believe Johnny lost the initial suit against the Sun.  The Sun made like 14 allegations of abuse against Depp citing only Amber’s allegations.  The judge only had to believe that ONE of the 14 allegations could be true...that is an insane standard to beat, especially when you’re only going off of one parties word.  IMO Amber seems like a manipulative and unhinged person and I just don’t believe her.  I don’t believe Depp is 100% innocent for that matter, but I do believe that Amber was the primary emotional and physical aggressor and the abusive party.  You can hear it in the recordings from her own words.  She puts Depp down insinuating he’s old and fat and then refuses to take any responsibility for her physical aggression, instead insisting that Depp is responsible for her actions because he doesn’t stay around to endure her abuse.  I’m sure I’m going to get a lot of heat on this thread for my comment but it’s what I truly believe based on my experience.  I’m including links to some articles, I know they aren’t all the most reliable sources, but celebrity gossip and civil allegations aren’t often covered by the MSM.\n",

The fact is that the Depp supporters are so scared of this woman, also because she support LGBT rights, woman's rights and feminist rights, and also because she is strong and powerful. I will support her till the day i die and i will watch every movie that is going to make even if is boring to watch!</td>\n",

Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.\n",

       "- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.\n",

       "\n",
       "Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.\n",

You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.\n",

Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.\n",

       "Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.\n",

       "Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.\n",

       "Mr. Depp’s assaults included head-butting Ms. Heard, repeatedly hitting her and tearing out clumps of her hair, wrote Andrew Nicol, the British judge who heard the case, in a ruling issued online on Monday. In dismissing the case, he said the defendants had shown that what they published was “substantially true.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The assaults “must have been terrifying,” the judge wrote regarding incidents in March 2015 in Australia, in which Ms. Heard said that Mr. Depp assaulted her several times, including smashing a telephone beside her face. “I accept that Mr. Depp put her in fear of her life,” the judge wrote.\n",
       "\n",
       "The judge also acknowledged the risk Ms. Heard had taken in speaking up about the violence. “I also accept that Ms. Heard’s allegations have had a negative effect on her career as an actor and activist,” he said.\n",

       "Women’s rights groups in Britain praised the decision. “This is an important ruling and one which we hope sends a very powerful message: Every single survivor of domestic abuse should be listened to and should be heard,” Lisa King, a spokeswoman for Refuge, a British charity for survivors of domestic violence, said in a statement...\n",

       "The article [from NGN] called Mr. Depp a “wife beater” and urged the author J.K. Rowling to intervene and have Mr. Depp removed from the “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” movie series, based on her book.\n",
       "\n",
       "The newspaper’s legal team argued that the accusations in the article were “accurate and true.” Ms. Heard, 34, testified on the newspaper’s behalf and said in pretrial documents that Mr. Depp had assaulted her on 14 occasions during their relationship starting before they were married. Mr. Depp denied all of the claims, but the judge found that most of them did occur, citing a range of text messages from Mr. Depp among the evidence....\n",
       "\n",
       "After the ruling was issued on Monday, The Sun said in a statement, “Domestic abuse victims must never be silenced, and we thank the judge for his careful consideration and thank Amber Heard for her courage in giving evidence to the court.”\n",
       "\n",

       "Mr. Depp’s assaults included head-butting Ms. Heard, repeatedly hitting her and tearing out clumps of her hair, wrote Andrew Nicol, the British judge who heard the case, in a ruling issued online on Monday. In dismissing the case, he said the defendants had shown that what they published was “substantially true.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The assaults “must have been terrifying,” the judge wrote regarding incidents in March 2015 in Australia, in which Ms. Heard said that Mr. Depp assaulted her several times, including smashing a telephone beside her face. “I accept that Mr. Depp put her in fear of her life,” the judge wrote.\n",
       "\n",

       "Women’s rights groups in Britain praised the decision. “This is an important ruling and one which we hope sends a very powerful message: Every single survivor of domestic abuse should be listened to and should be heard,” Lisa King, a spokeswoman for Refuge, a British charity for survivors of domestic violence, said in a statement...\n",

       "\n",
       "The newspaper’s legal team argued that the accusations in the article were “accurate and true.” Ms. Heard, 34, testified on the newspaper’s behalf and said in pretrial documents that Mr. Depp had assaulted her on 14 occasions during their relationship starting before they were married. Mr. Depp denied all of the claims, but the judge found that most of them did occur, citing a range of text messages from Mr. Depp among the evidence....\n",
       "\n",
       "After the ruling was issued on Monday, The Sun said in a statement, “Domestic abuse victims must never be silenced, and we thank the judge for his careful consideration and thank Amber Heard for her courage in giving evidence to the court.”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "- Ellen Barkin is an ex of Johnny Depp and made a deposition statement supporting Amber Heard for her Virginia, USA case. She wrote online that they only care about women after they are dead, after she re-posted an article about Amber. \"And we never will be...unless we're dead.\" \n",
       "- Kate Moss was found crouched in a corner after police were called when Depp was destroying his hotel room. Staff members believe he pushed Kate and that staff would walk away.\n",
       "- Witnesses in the trial speaking for Depp may be paid $100,000 as patrons of Depp, receive free housing, free jet plane rides, food, events, and followers who will even create accounts to support them. Even a 3-time felon can stay on Twitter, but AmberHeard Italia and other pages can be hacked.\n",
       "- Amber grew up in a violent household, where her mother stayed with her father despite this. To Amber Heard, as shown in this video about 'splitting', marriage and relationships are long-term, even with violence.\n",
       "- Elon Musk offered 24/7 security to Amber Heard when she wanted a restraining order against Johnny Depp. Texts show she had mentioned violence to Musk prior to this escalation.\n",
       "\n",
       "Amber data-collected the abuse against her with technology before 911 systems could collect real-time data from applications.\n",
       "\n",

       "Amber Heard took photos, texts, recordings, and evidence using her cell phone before it was culturally accepted.\n",
       "\n",
       "Heard, who tried to lead and speak against abuse, such as supporting a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights and going to the United Nations General Assembly just months before a defamation lawsuit was filed, has been retaliated against and silenced on the internet.\n",
       "\n",
       "Domestic violence is the most common incident experienced by 911 dispatchers in America, yet, no one talks about this or tries to do anything about it. There are up to 900,000 to 3 million reports of domestic violence a year in the USA.\n",

       "\n",
       "When people, tabloids, or agendas on the internet attack Amber, they are preventing the public from knowing that while you can see a food delivery or ridesharing services responding on a map, you cannot see first responders coming or when they’ve arrived. You cannot get language translations for 911 or an accurate location from data to public safety services. There’s no way to tell social media platforms to pull up data proactively to help crime victims or disaster victims.\n",
       "\n",
       "By criticizing her metadata and harassing the organizations that provided her opportunities, they’re preventing progress.\n",
       "\n",
       "When witnesses, reporters, businesses, and nonprofits supporting her are attacked online with 24/7 daily online harassment in attempts to remove any of her economic or relational support, and to even make people afraid of testifying, it’s enabling the culture of abuse preventing change that Amber Heard first wrote about in the Washington Post in December 2018.\n",
       "\n",
       "Two audios were framed on the internet in February 2020 leaving out her saying she did fear for her life, that she was kicked repeatedly, that bodyguards said that she would be killed, and being told that there were three physical fights since she hadn’t worked on yelling.\n",
